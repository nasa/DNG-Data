DNA extracted from each of the samples was used to create amplicon libraries based on customized panel of 500 antimicrobial resistance genes followed by next-generation sequencing. This is the first study of that shows the reservoir of antimicrobial genes in the ISS. The International Space Station (ISS) as a closed built environment has its own environmental microbiome which is shaped by microgravity radiation and limited human presence. The microbial diversity associated with ISS environmental surfaces was investigated during this study. Polyester wipes and contact slides were used for sampling of eight various surface locations on the ISS at different time periods. The samples were retrieved and analyzed immediately upon the return to the Earth (via Soyuz TMA-14M or Dragon capsule from SpaceX). After surface sample collection contact slides containing nutrient media for the growth of bacteria and fungi were incubated at 25 xcb x9aC. The polyester wipes were processed to measure microbial burden (R2A Blood Agar and Potato Dextrose Agar) and recover cultivable bacteria as well as fungi. Subsequently viable microbial burden was assessed using Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods after propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment. The 16S-tag and metagenome analyses were used to elucidate viable microbial diversity. The cultivable bacterial population yield from the polyester wipes was very high (5 to 7-logs) when compared with the contact slides (102 to 103 CFU/m2). The PMA-qPCR analysis showed considerable variation of viable bacterial population (105 to 109 16S rDNA gene copies/m2) among locations sampled. Unlike contact slides polyester wipes cover much larger sample surface (~1 m2) and produce much more reliable results of the microbial diversity of the ISS covering both cultivable and non-cultivable species. The cultivable total and viable microbial diversity was determined utilizing state-of-the art molecular techniques. The implementation of the PMA assay before DNA extraction allowed distinguishing viable microorganisms which is crucial for determining their role to the crew health the ISS maintenance and the general knowledge of the closed environmentally controlled built systems.","title":"Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO): Antimicrobial resistance genes - nasa_genelab_GLDS-66_25in-69gj","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-66","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO): Antimicrobial resistance genes"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/earth-nasa-00000337","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"2004-01-01/2005-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["atmospheric science data center","climatology","earth science","education outreach","hdf5","power","radiometry"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Robert O.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying both mechanosensation and mechanotransduction in osteocytes under the real microgravity (µG) condition are poorly understood. To unravel the mechanisms by which osteocyte, sense and responds to mechanical unloading, we exposed murine osteocytic cell line, Ocy454, seeded on a highly porous polystyrene 3D scaffold, to 2, 4, or 6 days of µG on board the International Space Station (ISS) and compared their gene expression with cells at 1G on Earth. Bioinformatics analysis of cells exposed to µG revealed several pathways differentially regulated upon exposure to microgravity.","title":"Osteocytes transcriptome is altered during spaceflight","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-324","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Osteocytes transcriptome is altered during spaceflight"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/rodent-research-1-rr1-nasa-validation-flight-mouse-gastrocnemius-muscle-transcriptomic-pro","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["animal husbandry","library construction","mass spectrometry","dna sequencing library construction","mouse habitation","tmt isobaric labeling","spaceflight","sample collection","rna sequencing library construction","protein extraction","nucleic acid extraction","nucleic acid sequencing","genelab rnaseq data processing protocol","labeling","epitranscriptomics","5mc total rna methylation analysis","data transformation","animal and tissue sampling"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-101_28my-svj6","description":"NASA  s Rodent Research (RR) project is playing a critical role in advancing biomedical research on the physiological effects of space environments.

The current investigation assessed viability of RNA DNA and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic transcriptomic and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment (RR-1) a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research.

A. fumigatus can adapt to various environmental conditions and form airborne conidia that are the inoculum for a variety of diseases (e.g. non- and invasive pulmonary infections allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis etc.) in immunocompromised hosts. In an on-going Microbial Observatory Experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) molecular phylogeny of several fungal isolates were characterized. Two strains ISSF 21 and IF1SW-F4 were isolated from the HEPA filter and the surface of the Cupola of the ISS respectively. Using primers targeting the internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and 2 both isolates were identified as A. fumigatus. The whole genome sequence analysis of ISSF 21 revealed increased number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) when compared to the reference A. fumigatus 293. Knowing that A. fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen and microgravity highly influences the antibiotic susceptibility and pathogenicity of microorganisms we examined pathogenicity of both ISS isolates using the zebrafish larval model. The space station isolates (ISSF-021 and IF1SW-F4) were more virulent than two clinical strains (Af293 and CEA10) whose pathogenicity was highly characterized.

Epidemiological data show that from adolescence through middle age cancer incidence increases with age. This effect is commonly attributed to a lifetime accumulation of cellular particularly DNA damage. However during middle-age the incidence begins to decelerate and for many tumor sites it actually decreases at sufficiently advanced ages. We investigated if the observed deceleration and potential decrease in incidence could be attributed to a decreased capacity of older hosts to support tumor progression and whether HZE (high atomic number (Z) high energy (E)) radiation differentially modulates tumor progression in young versus middle-age hosts issues relevant to estimating carcinogenesis risk for astronauts. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were injected into syngeneic mice (143 and 551 days old) which were then subject to whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu). Three findings emerged: 1) among unirradiated animals substantial inhibition of tumor progression and significantly decreased tumor growth rates were seen for middle-aged mice compared to young mice; 2) whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) inhibited tumor progression in both young and in middle-aged mice (with greater suppression seen in case of young animals) with little effect on tumor growth rates; and 3) 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) suppressed tumor progression in young mice to a degree not significantly different than transiting from young to middle-aged. Thus 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) acted similar to aging with respect to tumor progression. We further investigated the molecular underpinnings driving the radiation modulation of tumor dynamics in young and middle-aged mice. Through global gene expression analysis the key players FASN AKT1 and the CXCL12/CXCR4 complex were determined to be contributory. In sum these findings demonstrate a reduced capacity of middle-aged hosts to support the progression phase of carcinogenesis and identify molecular factors contributory to HZE radiation modulation of tumor progression as a function of age. For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina San Diego CA) were used. Total RNA was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification Kit (Ambion Austin TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. The number of tumor sample replicates used from each condition is as follows: 10 samples from young unirradiated mice 8 samples from young irradiated mice 7 samples from middle-aged unirradiated mice 5 samples from middle-aged irradiated mice. Total RNA was isolated and purified using Trizol (Invitrogen) or RNeasy (Qiagen) quantified and qualified using Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had O.D. 260/280 = 1.7 - 2.1 28s/18s = 2:1 RIN (RNA integrity number) >7. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using Ambion TotalPrep (Ambion) and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan (Illumina) and the data were analyzed using GenomeStudio (Illumina). Data were first analyzed for gene expression and then culled for present genes (genes that meet the criteria of detection p-value < 0.05). Expression above background was included in an expressed genes working data set for further analyses. Rank variant normalization was applied to the data before extensive analysis. Differential gene expression analysis was used to compare to the reference group young unirradiated mice and genes were then evaluated and validated.","title":"Age and Space Irradiation Modulate Tumor Progression: Implications for Carcinogenesis Risk - nasa_genelab_GLDS-88_2c3h-s3kg","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-88","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Age and Space Irradiation Modulate Tumor Progression: Implications for Carcinogenesis Risk"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/calipso-lidar-l2-polar-stratospheric-cloud-data-v1-00","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"2006-06-13/2014-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["atmospheric science","aerosol","satellite","radiation","eos","climate","cloud"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"John M.

To this end a cohort of forty 32-weeks-old female C57BL/6NTac mice were either sham operated or implanted with vehicle or treatment-filled nDS launched in two Transporters (20 mice per Transporter) on SpaceX-13 on December 15 2017. They were transferred to Rodent Habitats onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and maintained in microgravity for 29 days (N=20 Live Animal Return [LAR]) or >50 days (N=20 ISS Terminal). After 29 days the 20 LAR animals were returned live to back to Earth on January 13 2018,. After splashdown the animals were ambulatory on-ground for ~4 days until all subjects were processed during one day of dissections. There were two Baseline groups of animals sacrificed (LAR Baseline & FLT Baseline; N=20; 40 animals; ~36 weeks old) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC; 12/9/17). A Ground Control group mimicked the Flight LAR group which was housed at KSC then shipped alive to Novartis   Facilities where both the LAR and LAR Ground Control groups were processed (~41 weeks old; 1/16/18). All were anesthetized with isoflurane blood samples were obtained by closed-chest cardiac puncture and the animals were euthanized by exsanguination and thoracotomy. The 20 ISS Terminal mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine over the course of a four days of dissections (2/6/18 until 2/9/18; 53-56 days after launch; 44 weeks old at time of on-orbit dissections). Blood samples and euthanasia were conducted the same as LAR and Baseline. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection the ISS-terminal animal carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return. The ISS-terminal Ground Controls (at KSC) followed the same euthanasia timeline methods and preservation.

The environmental samples were collected with the polyester wipes from eight different locations in the ISS during two consecutive sampling sessions (three months apart). The specific objective was to unveil the pool of genes for each location during two separate sessions to learn of functional and metabolic diversity of microorganisms in the ISS. The International Space Station (ISS) as a closed built environment has its own environmental microbiome which is shaped by microgravity, radiation, and limited human presence. The microbial diversity associated with ISS environmental surfaces was investigated during this study. Polyester wipes and contact slides were used for sampling of eight various surface locations on the ISS at different time periods. The samples were retrieved and analyzed immediately upon the return to the Earth (via Soyuz TMA-14M or Dragon capsule from SpaceX). After surface sample collection, contact slides containing nutrient media for the growth of bacteria and fungi were incubated at 25C. The polyester wipes were processed to measure microbial burden (R2A, Blood Agar, and Potato Dextrose Agar) and recover cultivable bacteria as well as fungi. Subsequently, viable microbial burden was assessed using Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) assay, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods after propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment. The 16S-tag and metagenome analyses were used to elucidate viable microbial diversity. The cultivable bacterial population yield from the polyester wipes was very high (5 to 7-logs) when compared with the contact slides (10^2 to 10^3 CFU/m2). The PMA-qPCR analysis showed considerable variation of viable bacterial population (10^5 to 10^9 16S rDNA gene copies/m2) among locations sampled. Unlike contact slides, polyester wipes cover much larger sample surface (~1 m2) and produce much more reliable results of the microbial diversity of the ISS covering both cultivable and non-cultivable species. The cultivable, total, and viable microbial diversity was determined utilizing state-of-the art molecular techniques. The implementation of the PMA assay before DNA extraction allowed distinguishing viable microorganisms, which is crucial for determining their role to the crew health, the ISS maintenance and the general knowledge of the closed environmentally controlled built systems.","title":"Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO): Indoor microbiome study of the International Space Station surfaces - nasa_genelab_GLDS-69_33fi-nj84","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-69","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO): Indoor microbiome study of the International Space Station surfaces"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/microarray-profile-of-gene-expression-during-osteoclast-differentiation-in-modeled-microgr","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["p-gse21093-7","treatment group","specified_biomaterial_action","nucleic_acid_extraction","labeling","image_aquisition","hybridization","grow","p-gse21093-2","p-gse21093-3","p-gse21093-1","feature_extraction","p-gse21093-4","p-gse21093-5","p-gse21093-6","bioassay_data_transformation","p-gse21093-8"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-18_33mv-scxd","description":"Microgravity leads to a 10-15% loss of bone mass in astronauts during space flight. Osteoclast is the multinucleated bone resorbing cell. In this study we used NASA developed ground based Rotary Wall Vessel Bioreactor (RWV) Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) to simulate microgravity (uXg) conditions and demonstrated a significant increase (2-fold) in osteoclastogenesis compared to ground based control (Xg) mouse bone marrow cultures. We further determined the gene expression profiling of RAW 264.7 osteoclast progenitor cells in microgravity by agilent microarray analysis. Gene expression pattern was functional group clustered by transcriptome analysis using gene ontology tree machine (GOTM) for cell proliferation/survival differentiation and function. We confirm the microgravity modulated gene expression critical for osteoclast differentiation by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in murine bone marrow cultures. We identify transcription factors such as c-Jun c-Fos PU-1 critical for osteoclast differentiation is up-regulated in microgravity conditions. In addition microgravity resulted in 2.3 and 2.0-fold increase in the level of cathepsin K and MMP-9 matrix metalloproteinase expression in preosteoclast cells involved in the bone resorption process respectively. We also demonstrate a significant increase in the expression levels of M-CSF receptor c-Fms and PLCy2 and S100A8 molecules that play an important role in Ca2+ signaling essential for osteoclast function. Further microgravity stimulated preosteoclast cells showed elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels compared to ground based control cells. Thus microgravity regulated gene expression profiling in preosteoclast cells provide new insights in to molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of osteoclast differentiation/activation responsible for bone loss and fracture risk in astronauts during space flight mission. Microgravity associated with space flight is a challenge for normal bone homeostasis. Astronauts experience 10-15% bone loss during a space flight mission. We aimed to determine the effect of simulated microgravity on osteoclast preosteoclasts cells. RAW264.7 cells (1.5 x 106 /ml) were loaded in RCCS with DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were stimulated with RANKL (80ng/ml) for 24 h to obtain preosteoclasts in parallel with ground based control cells. Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol reagent (Biotecx Labs Houston TX) from control (Xg) and microgravity (uXg) subjected cells and hybridized with Agilent whole mouse genome 4x44K array system. Slides were washed and scanned on an Agilent G2565 microarray scanner. Data obtained were analyzed with Agilent feature extraction and GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 software packages (Genus biosystem Inc.

One signaling pathway that plays an important role in maintaining muscle and bone homeostasis is that regulated by the secreted signaling proteins myostatin (MSTN) and activin A. Here we used both genetic and pharmacological approaches to investigate the effect of targeting MSTN/activin A signaling in mice that were sent to the International Space Station. Wild type mice lost significant muscle and bone mass during the 33 d spent in microgravity. Muscle weights of Mstn -/- mice which are about twice those of wild type mice were largely maintained during spaceflight. Systemic inhibition of MSTN/activin A signaling using a soluble form of the activin type IIB receptor (ACVR2B) which can bind each of these ligands led to dramatic increases in both muscle and bone mass with effects being comparable in ground and flight mice. Exposure to microgravity and treatment with the soluble receptor each led to alterations in numerous signaling pathways which were reflected in changes in levels of key signaling components in the blood as well as their RNA expression levels in muscle and bone. These findings have implications for therapeutic strategies to combat the concomitant muscle and bone loss occurring in people afflicted with disuse atrophy on Earth as well as in astronauts in space especially during prolonged missions.","title":"Targeting myostatin/activin A protects against skeletal muscle and bone loss during spaceflight [plasma proteomics]","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-342","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Targeting myostatin/activin A protects against skeletal muscle and bone loss during spaceflight [plasma proteomics]"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/comparison-of-gene-expression-profiles-of-normal-human-bronchial-epithelial-cells-in-2d-an","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["p-gse27520-5","image_aquisition","hybridization","culture condition","bioassay_data_transformation","feature_extraction","p-gse27520-4","p-gse27520-6","p-gse27520-3","p-gse27520-2","p-gse27520-1","nucleic_acid_extraction","labeling","ionizing radiation"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-149_3ujn-ffq2","description":"The experiment is part of a project to study DNA repair process after ionizing radiation in organotypic 3-dimentional human bronchial epithlial cell culture.

A significant number of genes were up- or down-regulated by at least two fold in cells ,that were grown for 5 generations or 25 generations in HARVs. We identified genes in cell wall integrity signaling ,pathways containing MAP kinase cascades that may provide clues to novel physiological responses of eukaryotic ,cells to the external stress of a low-shear modeled microgravity environment. A comparison of the microgravity ,response to other environmental stress response (ESR) genes showed that 26% of the genes that respond ,significantly to LSMMG are involved in a general environmental stress response while 74% of the genes may ,represent a unique transcriptional response to microgravity. In addition we found changes in genes involved in ,budding cell polarity establishment and cell separation that confirm our hypothesis that exposure to LSMMG ,causes changes in gene transcription resulting in a phenotypic response. The results of the study provide interesting ,clues to potential mechanisms involved in the response to adaptation to and survival of eukaryotic cells in a ,microgravity environment and our findings may have important health implications for human spaceflight.

Deep high-throughput sequencing approach allowed us to analyze the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultured under gravity (G) and stimulated microgravity (MG) achieved with a clinostat. The present study identified totally 1870 miRNAs differentially expressed in HUVEC under MG condition when compared to the cells subjected to unitary G conditions. The functional association of identified miRNAs targeting specific mRNAs revealed that miRNAs hsa-mir-496 hsa-mir-151a hsa-miR-296-3p hsa-mir-148a hsa-miR-365b-5p hsa-miR-3687 hsa-mir-454 hsa-miR-155-5p and hsa-miR-145-5p differentially regulated the genes involved in cell adhesion angiogenesis cell cycle JAK-STAT signaling MAPK signaling nitric oxide signaling VEGF signaling and wound healing pathways. Further the q-PCR based experimental studies of upregulated and downregulated miRNA and mRNAs demonstrate that the above reported miRNAs influence the cell proliferation and vascular functions of the HUVEC in MG conditions effectively.

Various DNA damaging agents induce different spectra of DNA damage as well as collateral damage to other cellular components and therefore are not expected to provoke identical responses by the cell. Here we study the effects of two different types of ionizing radiation (IR) treatment HZE (1 GeV Fe26+ high mass high charge and high energy relativistic particles) and gamma photons on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Both types of IR induce small clusters of radicals that can result in the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs) but HZE also produces linear arrays of extremely clustered damage. We performed these experiments across a range of time points (1.5-24 h after irradiation) in both wild-type plants and in mutants defective in the DSB-sensing protein kinase ATM. The two types of IR exhibit a shared double strand break-repair-related damage response although they differ slightly in the timing degree and ATM-dependence of the response. The ATM-dependent DNA metabolism-related transcripts of the  xd2DSB response xd3 were also induced by other DNA damaging agents but were not induced by conventional stresses. Both Gamma and HZE irradiation induced at 24 h post-irradiation ATM-dependent transcripts associated with a variety of conventional stresses; these were overrepresented for pathogen response rather than DNA metabolism. In contrast only HZE-irradiated plants at 1.5 h after irradiation exhibited an additional and very extensive transcriptional response shared with plants experiencing extended night. This response was not apparent in gamma-irradiated plants. We treated 5-day-old WT and atm-1 seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana with 100 Gy of Gamma radiation (over a span of 15 minutes) or 30 Gy of HZE (over a span of approximately 12 minutes). Gamma irradiations were completed at 8:40 am while HZE irradiations were conducted in two runs (due to space limitations) which were completed at 1:09 and 1:28pm respectively.

The composition of the microbial community of this built environment is unique due to microgravity space radiation and elevated carbon dioxide levels. As built environments are known to have their own microbiomes next-generation sequencing methods have to be utilized to explore the ISS microbial profile and use this data for further development of safety and maintenance practices. ISS vacuum cleaner bag components (surface) and high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter element (air) samples were analyzed by traditional cultivation adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and propidium monoazide-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) assays to estimate viable microbial populations. In addition vacuum cleaner bag components of two cleanrooms at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL Pasadena CA) were examined concurrently. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing based on Illumina platform was used to elucidate the ISS microbial diversity and explore differences between the microbiomes of the ISS and Earth-based cleanrooms. The statistical analyses of these microbiomes show that Actinobacteria Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominate in the air and surface of the ISS and the cleanroom samples but vary in abundance. While members of Actinobacteria were predominant in the ISS Proteobacteria the least abundant phylum in the ISS dominated the Earth-based cleanrooms. The viable bacterial population (PMA-treated samples) decreased significantly but the treatment did not appear to have an effect on the bacterial composition (diversity) associated with a sampling site. Viable fungal sequences were not retrieved from the ISS HEPA sample where as highest viable fungal diversity was observed in the Earth-based cleanroom (JPL class 100K) debris. The results of this study provided strong evidence of substantial contribution of human skin-associated microorganisms such as Corynebacterium/Propionibacterium (Actinobacteria),not Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) species as the dominant species in the ISS in terms of viable and total bacterial community structure.","title":"Microbiomes of the Dust Particles Collected from the International Space Station and Spacecraft Assembly Facilities - nasa_genelab_GLDS-26_486j-u4xm","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-26","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Microbiomes of the Dust Particles Collected from the International Space Station and Spacecraft Assembly Facilities"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gazetteer-of-planetary-nomenclature-nasa-000003836","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1977-01-01/2014-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["space science","nen","geography","wise"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Jennifer Blue","hasEmail":"mailto:jblue@usgs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000038__36","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

To assess brain gene profile changes associated with microgravity and fluid shift a large-scale analysis of mRNA expression levels was performed in the brains of 2 weeks control and hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice using cDNA microarrays. Although to different extent all functional categories displayed significantly regulated genes indicating that considerable transcriptomic alterations are induced by HU. Interestingly the TIC class (transport of small molecules and ions into the cells) had the highest percentage of up-regulated genes while the most down-regulated genes were those of the JAE class (Cell junction Adhesion Extracellular Matrix). TIC genes comprised 16% of those whose expression was altered including sodium channel nonvoltage-gated 1 beta (Scnn1b) glutamate receptor (Grin1) voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (Vdac1) calcium channel beta 3 subunit (Cacnb3) and others. The analysis performed by GeneMAPP revealed several altered protein classes and functional pathways such as blood coagulation and immune response learning and memory ion channels and cell junction. In particular data indicate that HU causes an alteration in hemostasis which resolves in a shift toward a more hyper-coagulative state with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Furthermore HU treatment seems to impact on key steps of synaptic plasticity and learning processes. We used brains of four control (C1 C2 C3 C4) and four tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (E1 E2 E3 E4) mice to ensure statistical relevance of the study. 60 ug of total RNA extracted in TRIzol from each brain was reversed transcribed into labeled cDNAs using fluorescent Cy5 or Cy3-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences NJ).

NASA  s GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics systems biology-based approach and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA DNA and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic transcriptomic and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands quadriceps gastrocnemius tibialis anterior extensor digitorum longus soleus eye and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions and thus the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.","title":"Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse kidney transcriptomic proteomic and epigenomic data - nasa_genelab_GLDS-102_4fhm-d322","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-102","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse kidney transcriptomic proteomic and epigenomic data"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/expression-data-from-drosophila-melanogaster-nasagenelabglds-14ji5-bx4g","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["p-gse53196-1","p-gse53196-2","labelling protocol","array scanning protocol","radiation detection","normalization data transformation protocol","infection","p-gse53196-5","radiation dosimetry","p-gse53196-4","hybridization protocol","space flight","p-gse53196-3","nucleic acid extraction protocol","absorbed radiation dose"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-1_4ji5-bx4g","description":"Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery but requires a more complete understanding of the immunological consequences of long-term exposure to the conditions of spaceflight.

Understanding the long-term effects of isolation has relevance in a range of scenarios and it is well recognized that a better understanding of the relationship between environmental exposure and the epigenome can lead to more effective preventive measures. Here we conduct a longitudinal epigenetic mood state and biochemical profiling of 6 crew members in an experiment simulating a 520-day mission to Mars. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles. Firstly we found that long-term isolation can induce global DNA methylation remodeling and this change seems to be an active adaptation (rather than a random process or a by-product of the isolation). This study is the first to demonstrate the dynamic relationship between global epigenetic remodeling and isolation-induced mood state and biochemical changes. Secondly by considering the location of methylation sites within the genome and using gene-pathway annotation we were able to identify pathways that were significantly enriched in methylation events and consider their association with specific function and the timeline of the mission. Thirdly via our definition of epi-entropy a measure of entropy adapted to methylation events we observed that the methylation remodeling produced a marked reduction in epi-entropy. Results suggest that DNA methylation change is an indicator of change rather than its by-product i.e. there is a psychology-epigenome-metabolism model of long-term depression; DNA methylation programs the environment signal into the epigenome which is subsequently transformed into the biochemical output and health outcome. Thus longitudinal epigenetic profiling could code the effect of isolation and act as early indicators of latent health outcome. A longitudinal epigenetic mood state and biochemical profiling of 6 crew members in an experiment simulating a 520-day mission to Mars. 36 samples of blood cell DNA methylation profiling were obtained by Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip across 6 sampling points during the 520 days mission for all of the 6 crew members.","title":"Dynamic nature of epigenetic patterns observed during the Mars 520-d mission simulation - nasa_genelab_GLDS-140_54sh-hnwm","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-140","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Dynamic nature of epigenetic patterns observed during the Mars 520-d mission simulation"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/multi-omic-investigations-of-mouse-liver-subjected-to-simulated-spaceflight-freezing-and-s","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["tissue storage time","nucleic acid sequencing","mass spectrometry","animal and tissue sampling","nucleic acid extraction","library construction","labeling","freezing profile","extraction","proteomic labeling","protein extraction","sample collection"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-49_56j4-37dc","description":"This study compares standard laboratory protocols for tissue freezing and storage with a simulation of the delayed processing of liver specimens and long-term storage protocols used during the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) payload.

However hydrated magnesium sulfate mineral levels in the regolith of Mars can reach as high as 10 wt% and would be expected to be highly inhibitory to plant growth. A global approach was used to identify novel genes with potential to enhance tolerance to high MgSO4 stress. The early Arabidopsis root transcriptome response to elevated concentrations of magnesium sulfate was characterized in col-0 and also between col-0 and the mutant line cax1-1 - a mutant relatively tolerant of high levels of MgSO4-7H2O in soil solution. After 3 weeks of growth under hydroponic conditions Arabidopsis thaliana col-0 roots were exposed to a basic nutrient solution (0.25 g/L MES 1/16x MS pH 5.7) with an additional 2.08 mM magnesium sulfate (total Ca:Mg ratio = 1:15) for 45 min. 90 min. or 180 min. while a col-0 control set was exposed to the basic nutrient solution without additional magnesium sulfate for 45 minutes. Arabidopsis thaliana cax1-1 roots were exposed to the basic nutrient solution with additional magnesium sulfate for 180 min. only. Four replicate containers were harvested for the control and each of the treatment sets resulting in a total of 20 samples. Gene expression of the col-0 sets exposed to magnesium sulfate treatment for 45 min. 90 min. or 180 min. was compared to gene expression of the col-0 control set.

Microarray analysis revealed that C. albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 454 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.4% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to more normal bipolar budding patterns for ground samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, downregulation of genes involved in the actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested, as this regulator is involved in random budding, cell aggregation, actin cytoskeleton, and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. albicans. While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed. This study represents an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during spaceflight missions. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the general public. Cells were grown for 24 hours on the space shuttle or as ground-based controls, preserved in RNALater, and stored at -80C.

We tested the hypothesis that the receptor expression for M-CSF c-Fms was reduced. We used flow cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during flight to define the differentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; including CD11b CD31 CD44 Ly6C Ly6G F4/80 Mac2 c-Fos as well as c-Fms. In addition RNA was preserved during the flight and was used to perform a gene microarray. We found that there were significant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth. We found that there were significant changes in the distribution of cells that expressed CD11b CD31 F4/80 Mac2 Ly6C and c-Fos. However there were no changes in c-Fms expression and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded differentiation during space flight. We also found a pattern of transcript levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome but increased proliferation by the bone marrow macrophages that were assayed after 14 days of space flight. There also was a surprising pattern of space flight influence on genes of the coagulation pathway. These data confirm that a space flight can have an impact on the in vitro development of macrophages from mouse bone marrow cells.","title":"Evaluation of in vitro macrophage differentiation during space flight - nasa_genelab_GLDS-50_5azr-yp3p","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-50","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Evaluation of in vitro macrophage differentiation during space flight"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gazetteer-of-planetary-nomenclature-nasa-000003840","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1977-01-01/2014-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["wise","geography","nen","space science"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Jennifer Blue","hasEmail":"mailto:jblue@usgs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000038__40","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

Further this research field unveils new insights into connections between low fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process in vivo and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the global transcriptomic and proteomic response of an opportunistic pathogen that is actually found in the space habitat Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins with Hfq identified as a global transcriptional regulator in the response to this environment. Since Hfq was also induced in spaceflight-grown Salmonella typhimurium Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator across the bacterial species border. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight conditions were the lecA and lecB lectins and the rhamnosyltransferase (rhlA) involved in the production of rhamnolipids. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data of this organism grown in microgravity-analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology. Interesting similarities were observed among others with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen utilization. While LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight adopted an anaerobic mode of growth in which denitrification was presumably most prominent. Differences in hardware between spaceflight and LSMMG experiments in combination with more pronounced low fluid shear and mixing in spaceflight when compared to LSMMG conditions were hypothesized to be at the origin of these observations. Collectively our data suggest that spaceflight conditions could induce the transition of P. aeruginosa from an opportunistic organism to potential pathogen results that are of importance for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention both during spaceflight missions and in the clinic. This study describes the transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to low-Earth orbit environmental conditions. Our aim was to assess whether the microgravity environment of spaceflight could induce virulence traits in P. aeruginosa. To this end P. aeruginosa cultures were grown in space and the expression profile was compared with ground control samples (both in biological triplicate). Two RWV samples also examined (did not re-analyze them only compared the outputs).","title":"Transcriptional and proteomic response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to spaceflight conditions involves Hfq regulation and reveals a role for oxygen - nasa_genelab_GLDS-15_5jb6-2apd","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-15","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Transcriptional and proteomic response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to spaceflight conditions involves Hfq regulation and reveals a role for oxygen"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/calipso-lidar-l2-1-km-cloud-layer-data-v3-01","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"2006-06-13/2011-10-31","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["eos","cloud","satellite","aerosol","atmospheric science","radiation","climate"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"John M.

In this study we examine the impact of microgravity on the interactions between the squid Euprymna scolopes and its beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri which form a highly specific binary mutualism. First animals inoculated with V. fischeri aboard the space shuttle showed effective colonization of the host light organ the site of the symbiosis during spaceflight. Second RNA-Seq analysis of squid exposed to modeled microgravity conditions exhibited extensive differential gene expression in the presence and absence of the symbiotic partner. Transcriptomic analyses revealed in the absence of the symbiont during modeled microgravity there was an enrichment of genes and pathways associated with the innate immune and oxidative stress response. The results suggest that V. fischeri may help modulate the host stress responses under modeled microgravity.

Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS) it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. NASA  s GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics systems biology-based approach and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA DNA and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic transcriptomic and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands quadriceps gastrocnemius tibialis anterior extensor digitorum longus soleus eye and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions and thus the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.","title":"Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse eye transcriptomic and epigenomic data - nasa_genelab_GLDS-100_5v6f-5d73","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-100","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse eye transcriptomic and epigenomic data"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/alteration-of-proteomes-in-first-generation-cultures-of-bacillus-pumilus-spores-exposed-to","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["spaceflight","treatment","data transformation","growth protocol","protein extraction","mass spectrometry","labeling"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-259_5xrb-4y57","description":"Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 was originally isolated from the Jet Propulsion Lab Spacecraft Assembly Facility and thoroughly characterized for its enhanced resistance to UV irradiation and oxidative stress. This unusual resistance of SAFR-032 is of particular concern in the context of planetary protection and calls for development of novel disinfection techniques to prevent extraterrestrial contamination. Previously spores of SAFR-032 were exposed for 18 xe2 x80 x89months to a variety of space conditions on board the International Space Station to investigate their resistance to Mars-like conditions and space travel. Here proteomic characterization of vegetative SAFR-032 cells from space-surviving spores is presented in comparison to a ground control. Vegetative cells of the first passage were processed and subjected to quantitative proteomics using tandem mass tags. Approximately 60% of all proteins encoded by SAFR-032 were identified and 301 proteins were differentially expressed among the strains. We found that proteins predicted to be involved in carbohydrate transport/metabolism and energy production/conversion had lower abundance than those of the ground control. For three proteins we showed that the expected metabolic activities were decreased as expected with direct enzymatic assays. This was consistent with a decrease of ATP production in the space-surviving strains. The same space-surviving strains showed increased abundance of proteins related to survival growth advantage and stress response. Such alterations in the proteomes provide insights into possible molecular mechanisms of B. pumilus SAFR-032 to adapt to and resist extreme extraterrestrial environments.","title":"Alteration of Proteomes in First-generation Cultures of Bacillus pumilus Spores Exposed to Outer Space","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-259","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Alteration of Proteomes in First-generation Cultures of Bacillus pumilus Spores Exposed to Outer Space"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/effects-of-bedrest-and-hypoxia-on-human-skeletal-muscle-mirna-expression","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["normalization data transformation","treatment protocol","nucleic acid hybridization and data collection","sample collection","sampling time","bed rest","experimental campaign","rna extraction","labeling","scan protocol","sample collection protocol","treatment"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-198_63bx-knk2","description":"The present study concerns the effects of 21 days of sustained recumbence (bedrest) and hypoxia alone and in combination on skeletal muscle microRNA expression. 14 male subjects participated in 3 experimental campaigns in a counterbalanced fashion: normoxic bedrest (NBR) hypoxic bedrest (HBR) and hypoxic ambulatory confinement (HAMB) both hypoxic conditions with FO2 = 0.141 and PIO2 = 90  xc2 xb1 0.4 mmHg equivalent to an altitude of  xe2 x89 x88 4000 m).

We determined ,changes in the yeast model organism Saccharomyces cerevisisae when grown in LSMMG using the rotating High ,Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV). A significant number of genes were up- or down-regulated by at least two fold in cells ,that were grown for 5 generations or 25 generations in HARVs. We identified genes in cell wall integrity signaling ,pathways containing MAP kinase cascades that may provide clues to novel physiological responses of eukaryotic ,cells to the external stress of a low-shear modeled microgravity environment. A comparison of the microgravity ,response to other environmental stress response (ESR) genes showed that 26% of the genes that respond ,significantly to LSMMG are involved in a general environmental stress response while 74% of the genes may ,represent a unique transcriptional response to microgravity. In addition we found changes in genes involved in ,budding cell polarity establishment and cell separation that confirm our hypothesis that exposure to LSMMG ,causes changes in gene transcription resulting in a phenotypic response. The results of the study provide interesting ,clues to potential mechanisms involved in the response to adaptation to and survival of eukaryotic cells in a ,microgravity environment and our findings may have important health implications for human spaceflight.

However simulation experiments on ground testing space-related environmental constraints show differential responses. Curiously although particular genes are not common in the different experiments the same GO groups including a large multigene family related with behavior stress response and organogenesis are over represented in them. A global and integrative analysis using the gene expression dynamics inspector (GEDI) self-organizing maps reveals different degrees in the responses of the transcriptome when using different environmental conditions or microgravity/hypergravity simulation devices. These results suggest that the transcriptome is finely tuned to normal gravity. In regular environmental conditions the alteration of this constant parameter on Earth can have mild effects on gene expression but when environmental conditions are far from optimal the gene expression is much more intense and consistent effects.","title":"Environmental and facility conditions promote singular gravity responses of transcriptome during Drosophila metamorphosis - nasa_genelab_GLDS-70_6bs6-9fq8","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-70","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Environmental and facility conditions promote singular gravity responses of transcriptome during Drosophila metamorphosis"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/effects-of-spaceflight-on-the-immunoglobulin-repertoire-of-unimmunized-c57bl6-mice-nasagen","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid sequencing","spaceflight","nucleic acid extraction","library construction","sample collection","genelab rnaseq data processing protocol","data transformation"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-164_6buh-m96g","description":"Spaceflight has been shown to suppress the adaptive immune response, altering the distribution and function of lymphocyte populations. B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly diversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), that directly bind and neutralize pathogens. Ig diversity is achieved through the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA of each B cell in a host. The collection of Ig specificities within a host, or Ig repertoire, has been increasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS). We utilized HTS to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals, however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and IgÃŽÂº gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that space flight did not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time.","title":"Effects of spaceflight on the immunoglobulin repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6 mice - nasa_genelab_GLDS-164_6buh-m96g","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-164","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Effects of spaceflight on the immunoglobulin repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6 mice"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/expression-profiling-of-murine-lung-70-days-following-exposure-to-fractionated-or-acute-do","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["normalization data transformation protocol","nucleic acid extraction protocol","growth protocol","hybridization protocol","array scanning protocol","ionizing radiation","labelling protocol","p-gse42233-4","p-gse42233-5","p-gse42233-6","p-gse42233-7","sample treatment protocol","sex","fractionated dose","p-gse42233-1","p-gse42233-2","p-gse42233-3"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-148_6eff-568p","description":"Irradiation of the K-rasLA1 mouse model with a fractionated dose of 1.0Gy 56Fe- particles increases the incidence of invasive carcinoma compared to unirradiated controls or those irradiated with an acute dose.

To determine the effect of MG on the stress responses activated by the growth conditions we used RNAseq to examine what genes were expressed. For RNAseq the bacteria are harvested RNA isolated and converted DNA (cDNA) and the cDNA sequenced. Using bioinformatics the amount of expression of the different M. marinum genes were compared between the NG and MG samples. To make sure that we were examining only gene expression changes due to MG only bacteria in early exponential growth were used in the RNAseq studies. Triplicate NG and MG cultures were used to generate samples of bacteria grown for ~40 hrs. We also grew triplicate cultures for 4 days and then diluted them again and grew them for another ~40 hrs so we could examine gene expression from bacteria exposed for a longer time. In summary this study determined that waterborne mycobacteria alter their growth expression of stress responses and their sensitivity to oxidizing conditions when subjected to growth under MG.","title":"RNA-seq analysis of mycobacteria stress response to microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-90_6qn5-wwv8","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-90","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"RNA-seq analysis of mycobacteria stress response to microgravity"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/the-role-of-pthrp-in-osteoblast-response-to-microgravity-implications-for-osteoporosis-dev","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["normalization data transformation protocol","treatment","p-gse78980-5","p-gse78980-4","p-gse78980-3","p-gse78980-2","p-gse78980-1","nucleic acid extraction protocol","labelling protocol","hybridization protocol","genotype","array scanning protocol"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-107_6r5a-mnkd","description":"Prolonged skeletal unloading through bedrest results in bone loss similar to that observed in elderly osteoporotic patients but with an accelerated timeframe. This rapid effect on weight-bearing bones is also observed in astronauts who lose up to 2% of their bone mass per month spent in Space. Despite important implications for Spaceflight travellers and bedridden patients on Earth the exact mechanisms involved in disuse osteoporosis have not been elucidated. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulates many physiological processes including skeletal development and has been proposed as a gravisensor. To investigate the role of PTHrP in microgravity-induced bone loss trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) from Pthrp+/+ and -/- mice were exposed to simulated microgravity for 6 days. Viability of TOs decreased in inverse proportion to PTHrP expression levels. Microarray analysis of Pthrp+/+ TOs after 6 days at 0g revealed expression changes in genes encoding prolactins,apoptosis and survival molecules bone metabolism and extra-cellular matrix composition proteins chemokines IGF family and Wnt-related signalling molecules. Importantly 88% of 0g-induced expression changes in Pthrp+/+ cells overlap those observed in Pthrp-/- cells in normal gravity. Pulsatile treatment with PTHrP1-36 peptide during microgravity exposure reversed a large proportion of 0g-induced changes in Pthrp+/+ TOs. Our results confirm PTHrP efficacy as an anabolic agent to prevent microgravity-induced cell death in TOs. Total RNA samples extracted from Pthrp+/+and -/- trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) exposed for 6 days to simulated 0g in Synthecon rotating cell or left 6 days in culture at 1g. Cells had either been treated with a pulsatile treatment (2 h/day) of PTHrP1-36 peptide (10-8M) or received a change in growth medium. In total: 8 different conditions with 2 replicates each i.e. Pthrp+/+ TOs at 0g or 1g with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment and Pthrp-/- TOs at 0g or 1 g,with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment.","title":"The Role of PTHrP in Osteoblast Response to Microgravity: Implications for Osteoporosis Development. - nasa_genelab_GLDS-107_6r5a-mnkd","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-107","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"The Role of PTHrP in Osteoblast Response to Microgravity: Implications for Osteoporosis Development."}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/microbial-observatory-iss-mo-molecular-characterization-of-bacillus-issensis-sp-nov-isolat","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-09-05","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["sample processing","sample collection","spaceflight","sequence assembly","nucleic acid extraction","nucleic acid sequencing"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-64_6t7v-7nwx","description":"As part of an ongoing effort to catalogue microbial communities inhabiting the International Space Station (ISS) crew-associated environmental samples were collected from the Japanese Kibo Russian and US research modules.

Isolates were further characterized by whole genome comparative analysis. Each isolate was sequenced assembled and aligned against all members of the B. cereus sensu lato group. Based on genome size estimates (5.2 - 5.3 Mbp) strain nucleotide identity (>99.99%) and maximum likelihood phylogenetic placement all isolates were found to exhibit a very high level of similarity. With respect to gene content all isolates were inspected for cry proteins common to B. thuringiensis as well as toxins specific to B. cereus. No significant hits were found to any known cry genes while full-length matches were found for multiple B. cereus toxin genes. Finally the isolates were closely screened against B. anthracis genomes and no B. anthracis signatures were identified. Notably all isolates contained the plcR ancestral C allele and lacked significant hits to pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids and toxins. The collective results from the analysis confirm that these strains belong to a previously uncharacterized Bacillus species hereafter referred to as Bacillus issensis.

Microgravity and 3D culture can profoundly modulate cell proliferation and survival. Here we engineered microscale progenitor cardiac spheres from human pluripotent stem cells and exposed the spheres to simulated microgravity using a random positioning machine for 3 days during their differentiation to cardiomyocytes. Methods: RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA kit and the TrueSeq method was employed for mRNA enrichment. The libraries were quantified and samples were multiplexed in each lane of the flowcell. Cluster generation was performed and then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq1000 system. Reads were mapped on the Human Genome Reference and normalized expression table was generated. Results: Among differentially expressed genes 53 of them were up-regulated and 75 were down-regulated. Conclusions: Data demonstrate increased expression of genes associated with growth development and pro-survival in cardiac progenitors cultured under simulated microgravity compared with those cultured under standard gravity. RNA-sequencing analysis was performed to compare global gene expression profiles of cells at differentiation day 8 under simulated microgravity vs. standard gravity.","title":"Global gene expression profiles of cardiac progenitors differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells in 3D culture under simulated microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-127_74wu-xpjj","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-127","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Global gene expression profiles of cardiac progenitors differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells in 3D culture under simulated microgravity"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/transcriptional-analysis-of-dorsal-skin-from-mice-flown-on-the-rr-7-mission","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["spike-in protocol","animal husbandry","data transformation","duration","genelab rnaseq data processing protocol","library construction","mouse habitation","nucleic acid extraction","nucleic acid sequencing","sample collection","spaceflight","strain"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-254_75hb-pjph","description":"The objective of the Rodent Research-7 mission (RR-7) was to study the impact of the space environment on the gut microbiota of two strains of mice and how any changes in-turn affect the immune system metabolic system and circadian or daily rhythms. To this end ten 11-week-old female C57BL/6J and ten 11-week-old female C3H/HeJ mice were flown to the International Space Station on June 29 2018 on SpaceX-15 and housed in two Rodent Habitats. Samples of food swabs from living surfaces and fecal pellets were collected from each animal before launch and regularly during the mission. The mission also involved extended video collection (48 hr video segments per Habitat) to monitor circadian rhythms and on-orbit mass measurement. After 25 days on-orbit half of the mice of each strain were euthanized on the ISS with Ketamine/Xylazine/Acepromazine and cardiac puncture after which carcasses were segmented in three sections and preserved in RNA later. After 75-76 days the remaining 5 animals from each group were euthanized and processed in the same manner. The 25-day dissected carcasses returned on SpX-15 and the 75-day dissected carcasses returned on SpX-16. In addition to the Flight group three ground control groups were also part of the study: Basal (representing the pre-launch state) Vivarium (standard vivarium housing for the same duration of time as flight) and Ground (same habitat in the International Space Station Environment Simulator ISSES). Twenty mice (10 of each strain) were included in each of these control groups which were euthanized and processed on the same schedule and in the same manner as the flight samples. Dissections for tissues from all experimental groups were completed by the PI groups along with NASA  s Biospecimen Sharing Program in February 2019. GeneLab received dorsal skin samples from forty C57BL/6J mice: 10 Basal 5 Ground (25 days) 5 Ground (75 days) 5 Flight (25 days) 5 Flight (75 days) 5 Vivarium (25 days) 5 Vivarium (75 days).

Initial analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified 11 Bacillus isolates (two from Kibo Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) four from US Segment Harmony Node 2 and five from Russian Segment Zvezda module sites) all belonging to the Bacillus anthracis-B. cereus-B. thuringiensis group. Isolates were further characterized by whole genome comparative analysis. Each isolate was sequenced assembled and aligned against all members of the B. cereus sensu lato group. Based on genome size estimates (5.2 - 5.3 Mbp) strain nucleotide identity (>99.99%) and maximum likelihood phylogenetic placement all isolates were found to exhibit a very high level of similarity. With respect to gene content all isolates were inspected for cry proteins common to B. thuringiensis as well as toxins specific to B. cereus. No significant hits were found to any known cry genes while full-length matches were found for multiple B. cereus toxin genes. Finally the isolates were closely screened against B. anthracis genomes and no B. anthracis signatures were identified. Notably all isolates contained the plcR ancestral C allele and lacked significant hits to pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids and toxins. The collective results from the analysis confirm that these strains belong to a previously uncharacterized Bacillus species hereafter referred to as Bacillus issensis.

Gene expression profiles of tumors that arose in irradiated mice are distinct from those that arose in naive hosts. Host irradiation induces a metaprofile consisting of gene modules representing stem cells cell motility macrophages and autophagy. Human orthologs of the host irradiation metaprofile discriminated between radiation-preceded and sporadic human thyroid cancers. An irradiated host centroid was strongly associated with estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. When applied to sporadic human breast cancers the irradiated host metaprofile strongly associated with basal-like and claudin-low breast cancer intrinsic subtypes. Comparing host irradiation in the context of TGFB levels showed that inflammation was robustly associated with claudin-low tumors. The association of the irradiated host metaprofiles with estrogen receptor negative status and claudin-low subtype suggests that host processes similar to those induced by radiation underlie sporadic cancers. Total RNA was extracted from mammary tumors derived from transplantations of non-irradiated p53null mammary fragments into irradiated hosts. We analyized a total of 32 p53null tumors from irradiated wild type mice: 9 from sham-irradiated hosts and 23 from irradiated hosts.

Unsupervised clustering analysis of gene expression segregated samples according to the radiation (IR) response and time after exposure with 56Fe-IR showing the greatest level of gene modulation. 1H-IR exposures showed little differential transcript modulation. Network analysis categorized the major differentially expressed genes into cell cycle oxidative responses and transcriptional regulation functional groups. Transcriptional networks identified key nodes regulating expression. Individual transcription factors were inferred to be active at 1 3 7 14 and 28 days after exposure. Validation of the signal transduction network by protein analysis showed that particle IR clearly regulates a long lived signaling mechanism for p38 MAPK signaling and NFATc4 activation. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays supported the role of additional key transcription factors GATA-4 STAT-3 and NF-kB as regulators of the response at specific time points. These data suggest that the molecular response to 56Fe-IR is unique and shows long-lasting gene expression in cardiomyocytes up to 28 days after exposure. Additionally proteins involved in signal transduction and transcriptional activation via DNA binding play a role in the response to high charge (Z) and energy (E) particles (HZE).

To assess brain gene profile changes associated with microgravity and fluid shift a large-scale analysis of mRNA expression levels was performed in the brains of 2 weeks control and hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice using cDNA microarrays. Although to different extent all functional categories displayed significantly regulated genes indicating that considerable transcriptomic alterations are induced by HU. Interestingly the TIC class (transport of small molecules and ions into the cells) had the highest percentage of up-regulated genes while the most down-regulated genes were those of the JAE class (Cell junction Adhesion Extracellular Matrix). TIC genes comprised 16% of those whose expression was altered including sodium channel nonvoltage-gated 1 beta (Scnn1b) glutamate receptor (Grin1) voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (Vdac1) calcium channel beta 3 subunit (Cacnb3) and others. The analysis performed by GeneMAPP revealed several altered protein classes and functional pathways such as blood coagulation and immune response learning and memory ion channels and cell junction. In particular data indicate that HU causes an alteration in hemostasis which resolves in a shift toward a more hyper-coagulative state with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Furthermore HU treatment seems to impact on key steps of synaptic plasticity and learning processes. We used brains of four control (C1 C2 C3 C4) and four tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (E1 E2 E3 E4) mice to ensure statistical relevance of the study. 60 ug of total RNA extracted in TRIzol from each brain was reversed transcribed into labeled cDNAs using fluorescent Cy5 or Cy3-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences NJ).

To this end a flight group (FLT) of 10 week-old male C57BL/6J mice were launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on 8/14/2017 and housed in Rodent Habitats on the ISS for 33 days before being returned alive to Earth. After splashdown in the Pacific Ocean the animals were transported to Loma Linda University (LLU) for testing euthanasia and dissection on 9/18/2018. A Basal Control (BSL) was housed in standard cages at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and euthanized one day after launch of the FLT animals (8/15/2017). Ground Control (GC) and Vivarium Control (VIV) studies were planned to commence at KSC approximately one-week after the conclusion of the flight experiments. However all the GC and VIV mouse studies at KSC had to be cancelled due to Hurricane Irma and potential adverse effects on the animal housing facility. The GC and VIV studies were therefore rescheduled and begun in May 2018. The GC was euthanized and dissected 6/18/2018 - 6/20/2018 while the VIV was euthanized and dissected 6/22/2018 - 6/23/2018. Because this resulted in a different cohort of mice being used for the GC and VIV controls as compared to the flight (FLT) and basal (BSL) groups two cohort controls were included in the study. The first Cohort Control 1 (CC_C1) was from the same cohort as the FLT and BSL animals and was sacrificed and dissected 4 days after the FLT group (9/22/2017). The second Cohort Control 2 (CC_C2) was from the same cohort as the GC and VIV animals and was sacrificed and dissected 2-8 days after the GC and VIV groups (6/24/2018 - 6/26/2018). The CC_C1 and CC_C2 groups were housed in standard cages and fed standard chow in contrast to all other groups which received Rodent Foodbars. To clarify the connections between treatment groups and animal cohorts the following group abbreviations are used in the sample metadata: Flight (FLT_C1); Basal (BSL_C1); Ground Control (GC_C2); Vivarium Control (VIV_C2) Cohort Control 1 (CC_C1); Cohort Control 2 (CC_C2).

The effects of radiation are not limited to targeted cells and tissue and radiation induced bystander effects are significant to exposed individuals in accidental or therapeutic situations. These non-targeted effects of radiation have been studied extensively at the low dose range where they appear to have adverse effects on cells and surrounding environments. The requirement of cellular contact and shared fluid media has been established as critical to the bystander effect yet there is not much known about the actual signaling mechanism and its ability to transmit the damaging effect over space and time. Experimental cell types and context within the tissue are also quite important to the nature and extent of this bystander effect and must be considered when drawing parallels at the organismal level. Our approach was to use a genomic level analysis of global mRNA expression in primary lung fibroblast cells to understand the cellular triggers and mechanism of the bystander effect. Gene ontology and pathway analyses suggested that the p53 induced transcriptional response appears muted in bystanders while cytokine and cell signaling mechanisms such as those controlled by NFkB and p38 MAPK are highly active in both populations. We validated a large number of genes that are significantly changed at 4hrs after irradiation in both irradiated and bystander populations. We investigated time course gene expression profiles of cyclooxygenase2 (PTGS2) interleukin 8 (IL8) and BCL2 related protein 2 (BCL2A1) as genes that are involved in cellular signaling via the NFkB pathway which revealed that there is a dramatic response at 0.5hr after irradiation followed by another wave at 4hr in both populations. The induction of interleukins such as cytokine IL8 and chemokine IL6 at the transcriptional level is both early and amplified and if followed by translation and secretion of these proteins could explain the concerted response seen in bystander cells. Our results are the first to show that there is a significant and distinct global response of cellular signaling genes in bystander cells with some genes showing a response as early as 0.5hr after irradiation which implies a fast moving intercellular signal that leads to a concerted response in the irradiated and bystander populations.

However simulation experiments on ground without space constraints show weaker effects than space environment. A global and integrative analysis using the gene expression dynamics inspector (GEDI) self-organizing maps reveals a subtle response of the transcriptome using different populations and microgravity and hypergravity simulation devices. These results suggest that in addition to behavioural responses that can be detected also at the gene expression level the transcriptome is finely tuned to normal gravity. The alteration of this constant parameter on Earth can have effects on gene expression that depends both on the environmental conditions and the ground based facility used to compensate the gravity vector. Alternative and commons effects of mechanical facilities like the Random Positioning Machine and a centrifuge and strong magnetic field ones like a cryogenically cooled superconductive magnet are discussed.

In contrast the extrinsic TRAIL/TRAIL-Receptor-mediated death pathway remained highly active and exogenous TRAIL induced higher levels of apoptosis in rho0 cells compared to rho+ HSF. Global gene expression analysis using microarray and quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that expression levels of many growth factors and their adaptor proteins (FGF13 HGF IGFBP4 IGFBP6 IGFL2) cytokines (IL6 IL17B IL18 IL19 IL28B) and cytokine receptors (IL1R1 IL21R IL31RA) were substantially decreased after mitochondrial depletion. Some of these genes were targets of NF-kappaB and STAT3 and their protein products could regulate the STAT3 signaling pathway. Alpha-irradiation induced expression of several NF-kappaB/STAT3 target genes including IL1A IL1B IL6 PTGS2/COX2 and MMP12 in rho+ HSF but this response was substantially decreased in rho0 HSF. Suppression of the IKK-NF-kappaB pathway by the small molecular inhibitor BMS-345541 and of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway by AG490 dramatically increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the control and irradiated rho+ HSF. Inhibitory antibodies against IL6 the main activator of JAK2-STAT3 pathway added into the cell media also increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in rho+ HSF. However NF-kappaB activation was partially lost in mitochondrial DNA-depleted HSF resulting in downregulation of the basal or radiation-induced expression of numerous NF-kappaB targets further suppressing IL6-JAK2-STAT3 that in concert with NF-kappaB regulated protection against TRAIL-induced apoptosis. There are 12 total samples 3 biological replicates each of HSF rho+ and rho0 cells that were not irradiated (control=C) or irradiated (alpha=A). Cells were harvested at 4 hours after treatment.","title":"Human skin fibroblast mitochondrial depletion 0.5 Gy alpha-particle","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-182","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Human skin fibroblast mitochondrial depletion 0.5 Gy alpha-particle"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/lat-bright-source-list","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["acd","glast","egret","compton","cgro","bursts","balloon","gamma-ray","high-energy","gssc","gro","energy","fermi","glast ssc","gamma"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Phil Newman","hasEmail":"mailto:panewman@lheapop.gsfc.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000222","description":"The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) Large Area Telescope (LAT) is a successor to EGRET, with greatly improved sensitivity, resolution, and energy range.

Perturbations in DDR pathway can originate from alteration in the functionality of the microRNA-mediated gene regulation being microRNAs (miRNAs) small noncoding RNA that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. In this study we gained insight into the role of miRNAs in the regulation of DDR to IR under microgravity a condition of weightlessness experienced by astronauts during space missions which could have a synergistic action on cells increasing the risk of radiation exposure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed miRNA expression profile of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) incubated for 4 and 24 h in normal gravity (1 g) and in modeled microgravity (MMG) during the repair time after irradiation with 0.2 and 2Gy of gamma-rays. Our results show that MMG alters miRNA expression signature of irradiated PBL by decreasing the number of radio-responsive miRNAs. Moreover let-7i* miR-7 miR-7-1* miR-27a miR-144 miR-200a miR-598 miR-650 are deregulated by the combined action of radiation and MMG. Integrated analyses of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles carried out on PBL of the same donors identified significant miRNA-mRNA anti-correlations of DDR pathway. Gene Ontology analysis reports that the biological category of Response to DNA damage is enriched when PBL are incubated in 1 g but not in MMG. Moreover some anti-correlated genes of p53-pathway show a different expression level between 1 g and MMG. Functional validation assays using luciferase reporter constructs confirmed miRNA-mRNA interactions derived from target prediction analyses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: On the whole by integrating the transcriptome and microRNome we provide evidence that modeled microgravity can affects the DNA-damage response to IR in human PBL. Overall Design: Gene expression signature was defined in PBL irradiated with gamma-rays (2.0 Gy) and incubated in modeled microgravity (mmg) and in parallel ground conditions (1g) for 24h. Five independent experiments were performed for each donor to address which mRNAs were regulated on IR stress. The level of each transcript was represented as Log2.","title":"Gene expression profiling of PBL in response to ionising radiation and modeled microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-129_84ea-fpze","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-129","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Gene expression profiling of PBL in response to ionising radiation and modeled microgravity"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gazetteer-of-planetary-nomenclature-nasa-000003817","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1977-01-01/2014-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["geography","space science","wise","nen"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Jennifer Blue","hasEmail":"mailto:jblue@usgs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000038__17","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

Microarray analysis revealed that C. albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 454 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.4% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to more normal bipolar budding patterns for ground samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, downregulation of genes involved in the actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested, as this regulator is involved in random budding, cell aggregation, actin cytoskeleton, and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. albicans. While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed. This study represents an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during spaceflight missions. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the general public. Cells were grown for 24 hours on the space shuttle or as ground-based controls, preserved in RNALater, and stored at -80C. Four samples of each flight- and ground-based controls were harvested for microarray analysis. GAP is Group Activation Pack and each GAP contains 8 FPAs. The numbers represent the # assigned to the particular GAP and the number assigned to the specific FPA (1-8) within the indicated GAP.

Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that in addition to targeting advantages proton irradiation can inhibit angiogenic and immune factors and thereby modulate tumor progression. High-energy protons also constitute a principal component of the galactic cosmic rays to which astronauts are exposed. Increased understanding of the biological effects of proton exposure would thus contribute to both improved cancer therapy and carcinogenesis risk assessment for space travel. In addition age plays a major role in tumor incidence and is a critical consideration for estimating cancer risk. We investigated the effects of host age and proton exposure on tumor progression. Tumor lag time and growth dynamics were tracked following injection of murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells into young (68 day) versus old (736 day) mice with or without coincident irradiation. Tumor progression was suppressed in old compared to young mice. Differences in progression were further modulated by proton irradiation (1GeV) with increased inhibition evident in old mice. Through global transcriptome analysis TGFB1 and TGFB2 were determined to be key players that contributed to the tumor dynamics observed. These findings point to older hosts providing decreased systemic tumor support which can be further inhibited by proton irradiation. Overall design: For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina San Diego CA) were used. Total RNA was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification Kit (Ambion Austin TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. For tumor replicates thirty tumor samples from adolescent and thirty tumor samples from old mice for a total of 60 tumor samples were used. All replicate samples were run individually. For each age group ten tumor samples had received proton irradiation while twenty tumor samples were from unirradiated mice (as described above). Total RNA was isolated and purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and quantified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had 28s/18s = 2:1 RIN >7. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using AmbionTotalPrep and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan System. The data was checked with GenomeStudio (Illumina) for quality control. In GenomeStudio data was background subtracted and rank invariant normalization was applied. Data was imported into MultiExperiment Viewer MeV for statistical analysis.

The 7903 genes were selected as differentially expressed genes and divided into five sets with similar expression patterns using k-means clustering. Results from Gene Ontology analysis are significantly indicated that the cell cycle related genes and the TGF?/insulin-like signal pathway related genes changed.

It is unknown to what extent the irradiated microenvironment contributes to the differential carcinogenic potential of densely ionizing radiation. To address this gap 10-week old BALB/c mice were irradiated with 100 cGy sparsely ionizing g-radiation or 10 30 or 80 cGy of densely ionizing 350 MeV/amu Si particles and transplanted 3 days later with syngeneic Trp53 null mammary fragments. Tumor appearance was monitored for 600 days. Tumors arising in Si-particle irradiated mice had a shorter median time to appearance grew faster and were more likely to metastasize. Most tumors arising in sham-irradiated mice were ER-positive pseudo-glandular and contained both basal keratin 14 and luminal keratin 8/18 cells (designated K14/18) while most tumors arising in irradiated hosts were K8/18 positive (designated K18) and ER negative. Comparison of K18 vs K14/18 tumor expression profiles showed that genes increased in K18 tumors were associated with ERBB2 and KRAS while decreased genes overlapped with those down regulated in metastasis and by loss of E-cadherin. Consistent with this K18 tumors grew faster than K14/18 tumors and more mice with K18 tumors developed lung metastases compared to mice with K14/18 tumors. However K18 tumors arising in Si-particle irradiated mice grew even faster and were more metastatic compared to control mice. A K18 Si-irradiated host profile was enriched in genes involved in mammary stem cells stroma and Notch signaling. Thus systemic responses to densely ionizing radiation enriches for a ER-negative K18-positive tumor whose biology is more aggressive compared to similar tumors arising in non-irradiated hosts. Key Words: ionizing radiation; breast cancer; heavy ion radiation;initiation; promotion 3 different dose of Si were used. Total RNA was extracted from mammary tumors derived from transplantations of non-irradiated p53null mammary fragments into irradiated hosts. We analyzed a total of 45 Trp53-null tumors: 18 from sham-irradiated hosts 9 from 10 cGy Si-irradiated hosts 10 from 30 cGy Si-irradiated hosts and 8 from irradiated hosts.","title":"Densely Ionizing Radiation Effects on the Microenvironment Promote Aggressive Trp53 Null Mammary Carcinomas - nasa_genelab_GLDS-74_8gfi-6fri","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-74","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Densely Ionizing Radiation Effects on the Microenvironment Promote Aggressive Trp53 Null Mammary Carcinomas"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/calipso-wide-field-camera-wfc-l1b-science-1-km-registered-science-data-v3-01","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"2006-06-13/2011-10-31","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["satellite","radiation","aerosol","climate","atmospheric science","eos","cloud"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"John M.

To this end a flight group (FLT) of 10-week-old male C57BL/6J mice was launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on 8/14/2017 and housed in Rodent Habitats on the ISS for 33 days before being returned alive to Earth. After splashdown in the Pacific Ocean the animals were transported to Loma Linda University (LLU) for testing euthanasia and dissection on 9/18/2018. A Basal Control (BSL) was housed in standard cages at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and euthanized one day after launch of the FLT animals (8/15/2017). Ground Control (GC) and Vivarium Control (VIV) studies were planned to commence at KSC approximately one-week after the conclusion of the flight experiments. However all the GC and VIV mouse studies at KSC had to be cancelled due to Hurricane Irma and potential adverse effects on the animal housing facility. The GC and VIV studies were therefore rescheduled and begun in May 2018. The GC was euthanized and dissected 6/18/2018 - 6/20/2018 while the VIV was euthanized and dissected 6/22/2018 - 6/23/2018. Because this resulted in a different cohort of mice being used for the GC and VIV controls as compared to the flight (FLT) and basal (BSL) groups two cohort controls were included in the study. The first Cohort Control 1 (CC_C1) was from the same cohort as the FLT and BSL animals and was sacrificed and dissected 4 days after the FLT group (9/22/2017). The second Cohort Control 2 (CC_C2) was from the same cohort as the GC and VIV animals and was sacrificed and dissected 2-8 days after the GC and VIV groups (6/24/2018 - 6/26/2018). The CC_C1 and CC_C2 groups were housed in standard cages and fed standard chow in contrast to all other groups which received Rodent Foodbars.

As a ubiquitous environmental organism that is occasionally part of the human flora Pseudomonas aeruginosa could pose a health hazard for the immuno-compromised astronauts. In order to gain insights in the behavior of P. aeruginosa in spaceflight conditions two spaceflight-analogue culture systems i.e. the rotating wall vessel (RWV) and the random position machine (RPM) were used. Microarray analysis of P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown in the low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment of the RWV compared to the normal gravity control (NG) revealed a regulatory role for AlgU (RpoE). Specifically P. aeruginosa cultured in LSMMG exhibited increased alginate production and up-regulation of AlgU-controlled transcripts including those encoding stress-related proteins. This study also shows the involvement of Hfq in the LSMMG response consistent with its previously identified role in the Salmonella LSMMG- and spaceflight response. Furthermore cultivation in LSMMG increased heat and oxidative stress resistance and caused a decrease in the culture oxygen transfer rate. Interestingly the global transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa grown in the RPM was similar to that in NG. The possible role of differences in fluid mixing between the RWV and RPM is discussed with the overall collective data favoring the RWV as the optimal model to study the LSMMG-response of suspended cells. This study represents a first step towards the identification of specific virulence mechanisms of P. aeruginosa activated in response to spaceflight-analogue conditions and could direct future research regarding the risk assessment and prevention of Pseudomonas infections for the crew in flight and the general public. The wild type P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain (ATCC 15692) was used in this study and all cultures were grown in Lennox L Broth Base (LB) (Life Technologies) at 28 C. An overnight shaking culture (125 r.p.m.) of P. aeruginosa in LB was washed and diluted in 0.85% NaCl solution to an OD600 of 1. This bacterial suspension was used to inoculate fresh LB medium at a final concentration of 10-4 CFU/ml. Synthecon Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactors (RWV) (50 ml or 10 ml) were filled with inoculated medium so that no headspace (i.e. no bubbles) was present. Other than for stress resistance assays for which 10 ml capacity bioreactors were used RWV bioreactors with a capacity of 50 ml were adopted for all experiments. Identical bioreactors were mounted in triplicate on (i) a RWV device in vertical position (LSMMG) (Cellon) (ii) a RWV device in horizontal position (NG) and (iii) the center of the inner Random Positioning Machine (RPM) frame (RG) (Fokker Space) and placed in a large humidified (70%-80% relative humidity) culture chamber to avoid evaporation of culture medium through the gas-permeable membrane at the back of each vessel (Figure 1). A 25 r.p.m. rotation speed was adopted for the RWV cultures while RPM-cultures were randomly rotated at 10 r.p.m. (60 degree/s). Bacteria were grown in the three described test conditions for 24 hours. After 24 hours of cultivation the contents of every bioreactor was gently mixed by pipetting and divided into several aliquots. Ten millilitres of culture from each growth condition was immediately fixed with RNA Protect Reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer  s instructions and fixed cell pellets were frozen at -20C until RNA extraction. Samples were immediately exposed to different stresses.","title":"Response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to low shear modeled microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-14_8t4h-8h7j","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-14","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to low shear modeled microgravity"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/transcriptomic-analysis-of-dorsal-skin-from-mice-flown-on-the-mhu-2-mission","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["sample collection","mouse habitation","library construction","animal husbandry","spike-in protocol","nucleic acid extraction","spaceflight","data transformation","altered gravity","genelab rnaseq data processing protocol","nucleic acid sequencing","diet"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-238_8t6a-rjyd","description":"The JAXA MHU-2 mission had two objectives: 1) To increase understanding of effects of spaceflight on the gut environment (microbiota and metabolites) and immune system using multi-omics based analysis; 2) To evaluate whether fructo-oligosaccharides added to the diet as prebiotics improve the gut environment and immune function during spaceflight.

Proton irradiation on tumors induces biological modulations including inhibition of angiogenic and immune factors critical to     hallmark     processes impacting tumor development in addition to physical targeting advantages. These advantages have provided promising results for proton therapy in cancer. Additionally protons have implications for carcinogenesis risk of space travel (due to the high proportion of high energy protons in space radiation). Through a systems biology approach we investigated how host tissue (i.e. splenic tissue) of tumor-bearing mice is altered with age with or without whole-body proton exposure. Transcriptome analysis was performed on splenic tissue from adolescent (68 day) versus old (736 day) C57BL/6 male mice injected with Lewis lung carcinoma cells with or without three fractionations of 0.5Gy (1GeV) proton irradiation. Global transcriptome analysis indicated that proton irradiation of adolescent hosts caused significant signaling changes within splenic tissues that support carcinogenesis within the mice as compared to old subjects. Increases in cell cycling and immunosuppression in irradiated adolescent hosts with CDK2 MCM7 CD74 and RUVBL2 as the key players were involved in the regulatory changes in host environment response (i.e. spleen). These results suggest a significant biological component to proton irradiation operative through host age that would indicate a modulation of host  s ability to support carcinogenesis in adolescence and the bestowal of resistance to immunosuppression carcinogenesis and genetic perturbation by old age.","title":"Proton Irradiation Impacts Age Driven Modulations of Cancer Progression Influenced by Immune System Transcriptome Modifications from Splenic Tissue - nasa_genelab_GLDS-89_8xrx-bh6a","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-89","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Proton Irradiation Impacts Age Driven Modulations of Cancer Progression Influenced by Immune System Transcriptome Modifications from Splenic Tissue"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/transcriptional-analysis-of-thymus-from-mice-flown-on-the-rr-6-mission","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid extraction","sample collection","nucleic acid sequencing","euthanasia","animal husbandry","spike-in protocol","duration","dissection condition","data transformation","spaceflight","mouse habitation","library construction","genelab rnaseq data processing protocol"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-244_8y63-bwh7","description":"The objective of the Rodent Research-6 (RR-6) study was to evaluate muscle atrophy in mice during spaceflight and to test the efficacy of a novel therapeutic to mitigate muscle wasting. The experiment involved an implantable subcutaneous nanochannel delivery system (nDS; between scapula) which delivered the drug formoterol (FMT; a selective Beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist) over the course of time. To this end a cohort of forty 32-weeks-old female C57BL/6NTac mice were either sham operated or implanted with vehicle or treatment-filled nDS and launched in two Transporters (20 mice per Transporter) on SpaceX-13 on December 15 2017. They were transferred to Rodent Habitats onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and maintained in microgravity for 29 days (N=20 Live Animal Return [LAR]) or >50 days (N=20 ISS Terminal). After 29 days the 20 LAR animals were returned live to back to Earth on January 13 2018. After splashdown the animals were ambulatory on-ground for ~4 days until all subjects were processed during one day of dissections. There were two Baseline groups of animals sacrificed (LAR Baseline & FLT Baseline; N=20; 40 animals; ~36 weeks old) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC; 12/9/17). A Ground Control group mimicked the Flight LAR group which was housed at KSC then shipped alive to Novartis   facilities where both the LAR and LAR Ground Control groups were processed (~41 weeks old; 1/16/18). All were anesthetized with isoflurane blood samples were obtained by closed-chest cardiac puncture and the animals were euthanized by exsanguination and thoracotomy. The 20 ISS Terminal mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine over the course of a four days of dissections (2/6/18 until 2/9/18; 53-56 days after launch; 44 weeks old at time of on-orbit dissections). Blood samples and euthanasia were conducted the same as LAR and Baseline. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection the ISS-terminal animal carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return. The ISS-terminal Ground Controls (at KSC) followed the same euthanasia timeline methods and preservation. The final processing of frozen ISS-terminal frozen ISS-terminal Ground Controls and frozen 0-day FLT baseline animals were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute in Houston TX (5/21/18 until 5/24/18).

Because VIIP and IIH share some neurologic and ophthalmologic manifestations, the latter might be used as a model to study some of the processes underlying VIIP. This work constitutes a preliminary investigation of the molecular pathways associated with the elevation of ICP in IIH. Gene expression signatures were obtained from exosomes collected from CSF and plasma in patients with possible signs of IIH. The gene expression targets focused on inflammatory genes and miRNAs. The results suggest that inflammatory cytokine-driven processes and immune cell migration are activated when ICP is elevated in IIH patients, either as a cause or effect of the ICP increase. Several miRNAs appear to be involved in this response, among which miR-9 and miR-16 are upregulated in CSF and plasma of higher ICP subjects. This study provides evidence in support of neurophysiological alterations and neuro-immunomodulation in this condition.

Our results show that 42 miRNAs were differentially expressed in MMG-incubated PBLs compared with 1g-incubated ones. Among these miR-9-5p miR-9-3p miR-155-5p miR-150-3p and miR-378-3p were the most dysregulated. To improve the detection of functional miRNA-mRNA pairs we performed gene expression profiles on the same samples assayed for miRNA profiling and we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression data. The functional classification of miRNA-correlated genes evidenced significant enrichments in the biological processes of immune/inflammatory response signal transduction regulation of response to stress regulation of programmed cell death and regulation of cell proliferation. We identified the correlation between miR-9-3p miR-155-5p miR-150-3p and miR-378-3p expression with that of genes involved in immune/inflammatory response (eg. IFNG and IL17F) apoptosis (eg. PDCD4 and PTEN) and cell proliferation (eg. NKX3-1 and GADD45A). Experimental assays of cell viability and apoptosis induction validated the results obtained by bioinformatics analyses demonstrating that in human PBLs the exposure to reduced gravitational force increases the frequency of apoptosis and decreases cell proliferation. Gene expression profiling was carried out in MMG-incubated PBLs vs. 1g-incubated PBLs on total RNA extracted from the same PBL samples assayed for miRNA profiling. We used the Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray (Agilent) consisting of ~41.000 (60-mer) oligonucleotide probes which span conserved exons across the transcripts of the targeted full-length genes.","title":"Gene expression profiling of human peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured in modeled microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-56_9i5m-9p8i","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-56","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Gene expression profiling of human peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured in modeled microgravity"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/real-time-quantitative-pcr-analysis-of-human-cardiovascular-progenitor-cells-flown-aboard-","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["qpcr - mirna array","treatment protocol","reverse transcribed pcr","data transformation - mirna array","reverse transcribed pcr - mrna array","qpcr - mrna array","qpcr","data transformation","spaceflight","reverse transcribed pcr - mirna array","developmental stage","data transformation - mrna array","nucleic acid extraction","growth protocol"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-344_9i66-mc7f","description":"Adult and neonatal human cardiovacular progenitor cell clonal populations were flown aboard the ISS for 12 days prior to fixation in RNAprotect.

Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS) it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. NASA  s GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics systems biology-based approach and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA DNA and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic transcriptomic and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands quadriceps gastrocnemius tibialis anterior extensor digitorum longus soleus eye and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions and thus the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.","title":"Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse tibialis anterior muscle transcriptomic proteomic and epigenomic data - nasa_genelab_GLDS-105_9uag-wn64","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-105","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse tibialis anterior muscle transcriptomic proteomic and epigenomic data"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/salmonella-typhimurium-transcription-profiles-in-space-flight-nasagenelabglds-119wp5-r7cc","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["p-gse8573-9","absorbed radiation dose","bioassay_data_transformation","feature_extraction","gravity","hybridization","image_aquisition","labeling","nucleic_acid_extraction","p-gse8573-1","p-gse8573-10","p-gse8573-11","p-gse8573-12","p-gse8573-13","p-gse8573-14","p-gse8573-2","p-gse8573-3","p-gse8573-4","p-gse8573-5","p-gse8573-6","p-gse8573-7","p-gse8573-8","radiation dosimetry"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-11_9wp5-r7cc","description":"Salmonella transcription profiles were obtained from samples flown on space shuttle mission STS-115 and compared to profiles from Salmonella grown under identical conditions on the ground.

Various DNA damaging agents induce different spectra of DNA damage as well as   collateral   damage to other cellular components and therefore are not expected to provoke identical responses by the cell. Here we study the effects of two different types of ionizing radiation (IR) treatment HZE (1 GeV Fe26+ high mass high charge and high energy relativistic particles) and gamma photons on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Both types of IR induce small clusters of radicals that can result in the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs) but HZE also produces linear arrays of extremely clustered damage. We performed these experiments across a range of time points (1.5-24 h after irradiation) in both wild-type plants and in mutants defective in the DSB-sensing protein kinase ATM. The two types of IR exhibit a shared double strand break-repair-related damage response although they differ slightly in the timing degree and ATM-dependence of the response. The ATM-dependent DNA metabolism-related transcripts of the   DSB response   were also induced by other DNA damaging agents but were not induced by conventional stresses. Both Gamma and HZE irradiation induced at 24 h post-irradiation ATM-dependent transcripts associated with a variety of conventional stresses; these were overrepresented for pathogen response rather than DNA metabolism. In contrast only HZE-irradiated plants at 1.5 h after irradiation exhibited an additional and very extensive transcriptional response shared with plants experiencing   extended night.   This response was not apparent in gamma-irradiated plants.","title":"Gamma radiation and HZE treatment of seedlings in Arabidopsis - nasa_genelab_GLDS-320_a35t-v35m","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-320","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Gamma radiation and HZE treatment of seedlings in Arabidopsis"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/international-space-station-flight-project-extremophiles","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["data transformation","genelab amplicon-seq data processing protocol","sample location","sample collection","nucleic acid extraction","spaceflight","amplicon sequencing","library construction"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-279_a3f5-ttma","description":"The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique habitat for humans and microorganisms.

This rapid effect on weight-bearing bones is also observed in astronauts who lose up to 2% of their bone mass per month spent in Space. Despite important implications for Spaceflight travellers and bedridden patients on Earth the exact mechanisms involved in disuse osteoporosis have not been elucidated. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulates many physiological processes including skeletal development and has been proposed as a gravisensor. To investigate the role of PTHrP in microgravity-induced bone loss trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) from Pthrp+/+ and -/- mice were exposed to simulated microgravity for 6 days. Viability of TOs decreased in inverse proportion to PTHrP expression levels. Microarray analysis of Pthrp+/+ TOs after 6 days at 0g revealed expression changes in genes encoding prolactins,apoptosis and survival molecules bone metabolism and extra-cellular matrix composition proteins chemokines IGF family and Wnt-related signalling molecules. Importantly 88% of 0g-induced expression changes in Pthrp+/+ cells overlap those observed in Pthrp-/- cells in normal gravity. Pulsatile treatment with PTHrP1-36 peptide during microgravity exposure reversed a large proportion of 0g-induced changes in Pthrp+/+ TOs. Our results confirm PTHrP efficacy as an anabolic agent to prevent microgravity-induced cell death in TOs. Total RNA samples extracted from Pthrp+/+and -/- trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) exposed for 6 days to simulated 0g in Synthecon rotating cell or left 6 days in culture at 1g. Cells had either been treated with a pulsatile treatment (2 h/day) of PTHrP1-36 peptide (10-8M) or received a change in growth medium. In total: 8 different conditions with 2 replicates each i.e. Pthrp+/+ TOs at 0g or 1g with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment and Pthrp-/- TOs at 0g or 1 g,with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment.","title":"The Role of PTHrP in Osteoblast Response to Microgravity: Implications for Osteoporosis Development. - nasa_genelab_GLDS-107_a3s4-zqy3","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-107","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"The Role of PTHrP in Osteoblast Response to Microgravity: Implications for Osteoporosis Development."}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/calipso-imaging-infrared-radiometer-l2-data-swath-v3-nasa-0000139","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"2011-11-01/2013-02-28","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["aerosol","radiation","atmospheric science","satellite","cloud","eos","climate"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"John M.

Plant cell cultures disabled in HsfA2 function were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in order to ascertain whether or not they use the same terrestrially effective systems to adapt to the novel environment of spaceflight. Cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild type (WT) cultivar Col-0 and from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were launched to the ISS on SpaceX-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC17 spaceflight mission and were fixed in-flight after 10 days on orbit. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First differentially expressed genes were identified between the environments (spaceflight to ground) within cells of the same genotype which represented physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. Second gene expression profiles were identified between the genotypes (HSFA2 KO to WT) within the same environment defining genes uniquely required by the two genotypes in the ground and spaceflight adapted states. The physiological state of the cells as a result of disabling a gene has tremendous control over the mechanisms induced to adapt to the environment of spaceflight. The HsfA2 demonstrated a role in the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment since the cells disabled in the HsfA2 gene used substantially different genes to achieve the spaceflight adapted state than the WT cells. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) define the HSFA2 KO cells   physiological state regardless of the environment and likely result from the deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery. HsfA2 seems to have a universal stress response role but also specific roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling signal perception and transduction and starch biosynthesis. Implementation of knock-out cells identified a set of genes with a required expression level in order for a cell to achieve a spaceflight-adapted state. The HSFA2 KO cells helped to unravel the HsfA2-dependent genes of the adaption of wild type cells to the environment of spaceflight.","title":"HSFA2 functions in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated plant cells to spaceflight microgravity environment","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-205","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"HSFA2 functions in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated plant cells to spaceflight microgravity environment"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/a-molecular-genetic-basis-explaining-altered-bacterial-behavior-in-space-nasagenelabglds-9","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["antibiotic concentration","nucleic acid extraction","microgravity","nucleic acid sequencing","sequence analysis data transformation","treatment protocol","growth protocol","library construction"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-95_a7fg-4h9i","description":"Bacterial behavior has been observed to change during spaceflight. Higher final cell counts enhanced biofilm formation increased virulence and reduced susceptibility to antibiotics have been reported to occur for cells cultured in space .

However to date neither spaceflight results ground-based studies physical measurement techniques nor computational approaches have provided sufficient evidence needed to confirm this model. Gene expression data from the Antibiotic Effectiveness in Space (AES-1) experiment however have now allowed us to look into the biomolecular processes behind these observations and showed a systematic activation of glucose starvation and acid resistance genes. These results corroborate the reduced mass transport model proposed to govern bacterial responses to spaceflight. Furthermore the gene expression data suggests that metabolism was stimulated in space which could play a role in causing the observed increase in bacterial cell concentrations in microgravity.

Epidemiological data show that from adolescence through middle age cancer incidence increases with age. This effect is commonly attributed to a lifetime accumulation of cellular particularly DNA damage. However during middle-age the incidence begins to decelerate and for many tumor sites it actually decreases at sufficiently advanced ages. We investigated if the observed deceleration and potential decrease in incidence could be attributed to a decreased capacity of older hosts to support tumor progression and whether HZE (high atomic number (Z) high energy (E)) radiation differentially modulates tumor progression in young versus middle-age hosts issues relevant to estimating carcinogenesis risk for astronauts. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were injected into syngeneic mice (143 and 551 days old) which were then subject to whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu). Three findings emerged: 1) among unirradiated animals substantial inhibition of tumor progression and significantly decreased tumor growth rates were seen for middle-aged mice compared to young mice; 2) whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) inhibited tumor progression in both young and in middle-aged mice (with greater suppression seen in case of young animals) with little effect on tumor growth rates; and 3) 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) suppressed tumor progression in young mice to a degree not significantly different than transiting from young to middle-aged. Thus 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) acted similar to aging with respect to tumor progression. We further investigated the molecular underpinnings driving the radiation modulation of tumor dynamics in young and middle-aged mice. Through global gene expression analysis the key players FASN AKT1 and the CXCL12/CXCR4 complex were determined to be contributory. In sum these findings demonstrate a reduced capacity of middle-aged hosts to support the progression phase of carcinogenesis and identify molecular factors contributory to HZE radiation modulation of tumor progression as a function of age. For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina San Diego CA) were used. Total RNA was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification Kit (Ambion Austin TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. The number of tumor sample replicates used from each condition is as follows: 10 samples from young unirradiated mice 8 samples from young irradiated mice 7 samples from middle-aged unirradiated mice 5 samples from middle-aged irradiated mice. Total RNA was isolated and purified using Trizol (Invitrogen) or RNeasy (Qiagen) quantified and qualified using Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had O.D. 260/280 = 1.7 - 2.1 28s/18s = 2:1 RIN (RNA integrity number) >7. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using Ambion TotalPrep (Ambion) and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan (Illumina) and the data were analyzed using GenomeStudio (Illumina). Data were first analyzed for gene expression and then culled for present genes (genes that meet the criteria of detection p-value < 0.05). Expression above background was included in an expressed genes working data set for further analyses. Rank variant normalization was applied to the data before extensive analysis. Differential gene expression analysis was used to compare to the reference group young unirradiated mice and genes were then evaluated and validated.","title":"Age and Space Irradiation Modulate Tumor Progression: Implications for Carcinogenesis Risk - nasa_genelab_GLDS-88_a8nx-hpth","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-88","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Age and Space Irradiation Modulate Tumor Progression: Implications for Carcinogenesis Risk"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/bric-23-genelab-process-verification-test-staphylococcus-aureus-transcriptomic-proteomic-a","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid sequencing","extraction","sample collection","freezing","freezing control design and sample processing","labeling","library construction","sample processing","mass spectrometry","data transformation","metabolite extraction","metabolomics data transformation","metabolomics labeling","metabolomics mass spectrometry","proteomics mass spectrometry","proteomics labeling","proteomics data transformation","protein extraction","microgravity","nucleic acid extraction"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-145_a9yp-e648","description":"Microbes interact with humans in complex ways and understanding how they respond to the spaceflight environment is important to the success of future manned spaceflight missions.

A thorough understanding of the mechanisms leading to loss of muscle mass and structural disorders is necessary for the definition of efficient clinical and spaceflight countermeasures. We investigated the effects of long-term bed rest on transcriptome of soleus (SOL) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles in healthy women (BRC group n=8) and the potential beneficial impact of protein supplementation (BRN group n=8) and of a combined resistance and aerobic training (BRE group n=8). Gene expression profiles were obtained using an in-house made microarray containing 6681 muscles-relevant genes. A two-class statistical analysis was applied on the 2103 genes with consolidated expression. We identified 472 and 207 modified genes respectively for SOL and VL in BRC group. Further clustering approaches identifying relevant biological mechanisms or pathways underlined five main subclusters. Three are composed almost of upregulated genes involved mainly in nucleic acid and protein metabolism and two composed almost of downregulated genes involved in energy metabolism. Exercise countermeasure demonstrated a drastic compensatory effect decreasing the number of differentially-expressed genes by 89 and 96% in SOL and VL. In contrast nutrition countermeasure had a moderate effect and decreased the number of differentially-expressed genes by 40 and 25% in SOL and VL. Our results allowed reporting a systematic global and comprehensive view of long-term woman muscle atrophy and brought new lights and insights for space environment and for women who undergo a long-term clinical bed rest. Biological samples were collected from Pre- and Post- bed rest (BR) soleus and vastus lateralis biopsies of each subject from the three groups (bed rest only: BRC; Exercise: BRE; Nutrition: BRN). six technical replicate values (2 duplicate hybridizations a et b to chips with triplicate spots xxx) were obtained for each skeletal muscle sample. Thus for each subject 12 expression measurements (6 before BR and 6 after BR) were obtained for each muscle.","title":"Woman skeletal muscle transcriptome with bed rest and countermeasures. - nasa_genelab_GLDS-51_adw8-qgze","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-51","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Woman skeletal muscle transcriptome with bed rest and countermeasures."}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/non-targeted-effects-of-low-dose-ionizing-radiation-act-via-tgf-beta-to-promote-mammary-ca","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["image_acquisition","bioassay_data_transformation","data transformation","feature_extraction","genelab microarray data processing protocol","genotype","grow","hybridization","ionizing radiation","labeling","nucleic_acid_extraction","p-gse18216-1","p-gse18216-2","p-gse18216-3","p-gse18216-4","p-gse18216-5","p-gse18216-6","p-gse18216-7","p-gse18216-8","specified_biomaterial_action","time"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-153_aecm-zrsa","description":"This is a genome-wide approach to identifying genes persistently induced in the mouse mammary gland by acute whole body low dose ionizing radiation (10cGy) 1 and 4 weeks after exposure. Gene expression that is modified under these parameters were compared between Tgfb1 wild type and heterozygote littermates in order to determine which genes induced or repressed by radiation were mediated via Tgfb1 status. Differential gene expression was analyzed in Tgfb1 heterozygote and wild type littermate 4th mammary glands after whole body exposure to an acute dose of 10cGy ionizing radiation. Estrus cycle was normalized in all mice two days prior to irradiation by injection with an estrogen and progesterone mixture. It is widely believed that the carcinogenic action of ionizing radiation is due to targeted DNA damage and resulting mutations but there is also substantial evidence that non-targeted radiation effects alter epithelial phenotype and the stromal microenvironment. Activation of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta) is a non-targeted radiation effect that mediates cell fate decisions following DNA damage and regulates microenvironment composition; it could either suppress or promote cancer. Gene expression profiling shown herein demonstrates that low dose radiation (10 cGy) elicits persistent changes in Tgfb1 wild type and heterozygote murine mammary gland that are highly modulated by TGFbeta. We asked if such non-targeted radiation effects contribute to carcinogenesis by using a novel radiation chimera model. Unirradiated Trp53 null mammary epithelium was transplanted to the mammary stroma of mice previously exposed to a single low (10 -100 cGy) radiation dose. By 300 days 100% of transplants in irradiated hosts at either 10 or 100 cGy had developed Trp53 null breast carcinomas compared to 54% in unirradiated hosts. Tumor growth rate was also increased by high but not low dose host irradiation. In contrast irradiation of Tgfb1 heterozygote mice prior to transplantation failed to decrease tumor latency or increase growth rate at any dose. Host irradiation significantly reduced the latency of invasive ductal carcinoma compared to spindle cell carcinoma as well as those tumors negative for smooth muscle actin in wild type but not Tgfb1 heterozygote mice. However irradiation of either host genotype significantly increased the frequency of estrogen receptor negative tumors. These data demonstrate two concepts critical to understanding radiation risks. First non-targeted radiation effects can significantly promote the frequency and alter the features of epithelial cancer. Second radiation-induced TGFbeta activity is a key mechanism of tumor promotion. Keywords: Differential gene expression after low dose irradiation Two genotypes: TGBbeta1 heterozygote and wildtype mouse mammary glands. Two time points post-10cGy-irradiation per genotype (1 week 4 weeks); control time point was 1 week post-sham-irradiation.

RNA-Seq was used to define the large-scale gene expression profiles of Mizuna harvested after 27 days cultivation in the international space station to understand the molecular response and adaptation to space environment.Results: Total reads of transcripts from the Mizuna grown in the international space station as well as on the ground by RNA-Seq using next generation sequencing technology showed 8,258 and 14,170 transcripts up- and down-regulated in the space-grown Mizuna respectively when compared with those from the ground-grown Mizuna. A total of 20 in 32 ROS oxidative marker genes were up-regulated including high expression of 4 hallmarks and preferentially expressed gene associated with ROS-scavenging genes was thioredoxin glutaredoxin and alternative oxidase genes. In the transcription factors of ROS gene network MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3 OXI1-MKK4-MPK3 and OXI1-MPK3 of MAP cascades induction of WRKY22 by MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3 cascade induction of WRKY25 and repression of ZAT7 by Zat12 were suggested.

Here we assessed the impact of two high-LET ions 56Fe and 28Si and low-LET X rays on genome-wide methylation patterns in human bronchial epithelial cells. We found that all three radiation types induced rapid and stable changes in DNA methylation but at distinct subsets of CpG sites affecting different chromatin compartments. The 56Fe ions induced mostly hypermethylation and primarily affected sites in open chromatin regions including enhancers promoters and edges (  shores  ) of CpG islands. The 28Si ion-exposure had mixed effects inducing both hyper and hypomethylation and affecting sites in more repressed heterochromatic environments whereas X rays induced mostly hypomethylation primarily at sites in gene bodies and intergenic regions. Significantly the methylation status of 56Fe ion irradiation sensitive sites but not those affected by X ray or 28Si ions could discriminate tumor from normal tissue for human lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Thus high LET radiation exposure leaves a lasting imprint on the epigenome and affects sites relevant to human lung cancer. The 56Fe ion signature may prove useful in monitoring the cumulative biological impact and associated cancer risks encountered by astronauts in deep space. Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal human bronchial epithelial cells irradiated with varying doses of 28Si-ion radiation ( 300 MeV/u at 0 0.3 1.0 Gy)  56Fe-ion radiation (600 MeV/u at 0 0.1 0.3 1.0 Gy) or X rays (320 kV at 0 1.0 Gy). Triplicate control and irradiated samples were incubated and sampled at 4 timepoints between 2 and 62 days. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation Beadchip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles across >485,000 CpGs from collected samples. Samples include: 56Fe ions 4 doses x 4 time points x 3 replicates (4 removed in QC) = 44 samples; 28Si ions = 3 doses x 4 time points x 3 replicates = 36 samples; X ray 2 doses x 4 time points x 3 replicates (2 removed in QC)= 22 samples. Overall design: Bisulphite converted DNA from the 102 samples were hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450k Human Methylation Beadchip.","title":"Galactic cosmic radiation induces stable epigenome alterations relevant to human lung cancer","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-317","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Galactic cosmic radiation induces stable epigenome alterations relevant to human lung cancer"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/mlh1-deficiency-increases-the-risk-of-hematopoietic-malignancy-after-simulated-space-radia","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["['genotype' 'ionizing radiation']","['treatment protocol' 'nucleic acid extraction' 'library construction' 'nucleic acid sequencing']"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-340_auyp-jecu","description":"['Cancer-causing genome instability is a major concern during space travel due to exposure of astronauts to potent sources of high-linear energy transfer (LET) ionizing radiation. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are particularly susceptible to genotoxic stress, and accumulation of damage can lead to HSC dysfunction and oncogenesis. Our group recently demonstrated that aging human HSCs accumulate microsatellite instability coincident with loss of MLH1, a DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) protein, which could reasonably predispose to radiation-induced HSC malignancies. Therefore, in an effort to reduce risk uncertainty for cancer development during deep space travel, we employed an Mlh1+/- mouse model to study the effects high-LET 56Fe ion space-like radiation. Irradiated Mlh1+/- mice showed a significantly higher incidence of lymphomagenesis with 56Fe ions compared to Î³-rays and unirradiated mice, and malignancy correlated with increased MSI in the tumors. In addition, whole-exome sequencing analysis revealed high SNVs and INDELs in lymphomas being driven by loss of Mlh1 and frequently mutated genes had a strong correlation with human leukemias. Therefore, the data suggest that age-related MMR deficiencies could lead to HSC malignancies after space radiation, and that countermeasure strategies will be required to adequately protect the astronaut population on the journey to Mars.']","title":"['Mlh1 deficiency increases the risk of hematopoietic malignancy after simulated space radiation exposure']","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-340","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"['Mlh1 deficiency increases the risk of hematopoietic malignancy after simulated space radiation exposure']"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/fatigue-crack-growth-in-aluminum-lap-joint","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2023-03-31","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-03-31","keyword":["prognostics","structures","degradation","ivhm","phm"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Matteo Corbetta","hasEmail":"mailto:matteo.corbetta@nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"PCoE"},"identifier":"awzu-cpt8","description":"Fatigue experiments were conducted on aluminum lap-joint specimens, and lamb wave signals were recorded for each specimen at several time points (i.e., defined as number of cycles in fatigue testing).

The transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively express the mammalian type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase) an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes the lipid-derived second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). These transgenic plants exhibit normal growth and morphology; however their responses to environmental stimuli including gravity and drought are altered. Seedlings were grown for 5 days under continuous light in experimental containers placed in the European Modular Cultivation system (EMCS) onboard the ISS. The EMCS consists of two rotors within a controlled chamber allowing for a  x931g x94 control in space. After sample retrieval from the ISS RNA was isolated from shoot and root tissue and subjected to RNA sequencing. Two-way comparisons of micro g versus  x931 x94g have uncovered regulatory mechanisms that are both conserved and altered between the wild type and transgenic seedlings.","title":"The effect of spaceflight on transgenic Arabidopsis plants with compromised signaling","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-223","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"The effect of spaceflight on transgenic Arabidopsis plants with compromised signaling"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gazetteer-of-planetary-nomenclature-nasa-000003880","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1977-01-01/2014-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["geography","space science","nen","wise"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Jennifer Blue","hasEmail":"mailto:jblue@usgs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000038__80","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

Genes that are important in setting up the spaceflight responses are being identified; their role in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are required for survival has yet to be posed and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses of two Arabidopsis ecotypes Col-0 and WS as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS phyD displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0 suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the transcriptome cost of plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight and suggesting that genetic manipulation might further reduce or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0 suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation which further implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.","title":"Genetic Dissection of the Spaceflight Transcriptome Responses in Plants: are some responses unnecessary? - nasa_genelab_GLDS-120_b3ak-mpt9","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-120","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Genetic Dissection of the Spaceflight Transcriptome Responses in Plants: are some responses unnecessary?"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/near-earth-comets-orbital-elements","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2015-04-07","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-31","keyword":["platform","data visualization","intermediate","model","outerspace","airburstvisual","spaceapps"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"NASA Public Data","hasEmail":"mailto:no-reply@data.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.nasa.gov"},"identifier":"b67r-rgxc","description":"The table below provides J2000 heliocentric ecliptic orbital elements\r\nfor 170 NECs (Near-Earth Comets) sorted by object number/name.\r\n\r\nhttp://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/neo_elem?type=NEC","title":"Near-Earth Comets - Orbital Elements","programCode":["026:009"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/b67r-rgxc/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/b67r-rgxc/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/b67r-rgxc/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/b67r-rgxc/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/b67r-rgxc/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/b67r-rgxc/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/b67r-rgxc/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"theme":["Space Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/mapbook","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1962-01-01/2002-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["earth","crater","callisto","small bodies","space science","universe","nomenclature","imagery","neptune","saturn","geography","earth science","planetary science","wise"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Site Admin","hasEmail":"mailto:rpif@lpi.usra.edu"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000074","description":"Beginning with the systematic mapping of the lunar surface more than three decades ago, this database contains over 1600 maps of the planets and satellites of the Solar System.

Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS) it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. NASA  s GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics systems biology-based approach and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA DNA and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic transcriptomic and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research.

However the specific physiological response of caries-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space flight and/or ground-based simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study High Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV) S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles H2O2 resistance and competence in sucrose-containing biofilm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H2O2 compared to normal gravity control cultures but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated >= 2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated >= 2-fold during simulated microgravity HARV growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism translation and stress responses. Collectively these results suggest that growth under microgravity analog conditions promotes changes in S. mutans gene expression and physiology that may translate to an altered cariogenic potential of this organism during space flight missions.

T cells from 4 human donors were stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA) and anti-CD28 onboard the International Space Station (ISS). An onboard centrifuge was used to generate a 1g simultaneous control to isolate the effects of mg from other variables of spaceflight. Microarray expression analysis after 1.5 hours of activation demonstrated that mg- and 1g-activated T cells had distinct patterns of global gene expression and identified 47 genes that were significantly differentially down-regulated in mg. Importantly several key immediate early genes were inhibited in mg. T cells were isolated from human volunteers. T cells from each donor were kept separate and loaded into individual chambers in separate cassettes for the following treatments: mg non-activated mg activated and 1g activated. Therefore samples represent biological triplicates. Experimental units were launched into space and placed into the KUBIK facility onboard the International Space Station. The 1g units were placed in the central centrifuge positions and centrifuged with an applied 1g force. The mg units were place in the static positions for continued mg exposure. After 30 minutes of pre-incubation mg non-activated units were fixed by addition of RNALater (QIAGEN Valencia CA) removed from the incubator and stored in 4 xc2 xb0C. The mg and 1g activated units were injected with final concentration 10mg/ml Con A and 4mg/ml anti-CD28. These cassettes were replaced into KUBIK on either the centrifuge or static positions and activated for 1.5 hours. Activation was stopped with the addition of RNALater and the units were then moved to 4 xc2 xb0C storage. All units were returned to Earth for analysis.","title":"T Cell Activation in Microgravity Compared to 1g (Earth  s) Gravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-13_buib-mvh9","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-13","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"T Cell Activation in Microgravity Compared to 1g (Earth  s) Gravity"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/dissecting-low-atmospheric-pressure-stress-transcriptome-responses-to-the-components-of-hy","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["data transformation","genelab microarray data processing protocol","growth protocol","labeling","normalization data transformation","nucleic acid hybridization","rna extraction","treatment protocol","atmospheric pressure","data collection"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-136_but4-hnt9","description":"Controlled hypobaria presents biology with an environment that is never encountered in terrestrial ecology yet the apparent components of hypobaria are stresses typical of terrestrial ecosystems. High altitude for example presents terrestrial hypobaria always with hypoxia as a component stress since the relative partial pressure of O2 is constant in the atmosphere. Laboratory-controlled hypobaria however allows the dissection of pressure effects away from the effects typically associated with altitude in particular hypoxia as the partial pressure of O2 can be varied. In this study whole transcriptomes of plants grown in ambient (97 kPa/pO2 = 21 kPa) atmospheric conditions were compared to those of plants transferred to five different atmospheres of varying pressure and oxygen composition for 24 h: 50 kPa/pO2 = 10 kPa 25 kPa/pO2 = 5 kPa 50 kPa/pO2 = 21 kPa 25 kPa/pO2 = 21 kPa or 97 kPa/pO2 = 5 kPa. The plants exposed to these environments were 10 day old Arabidopsis seedlings grown vertically on hydrated nutrient plates. In addition 5 day old plants were also exposed for 24 h to the 50 kPa and ambient environments to evaluate age-dependent responses. The gene expression profiles from roots and shoots showed that the hypobaric response contained more complex gene regulation than simple hypoxia and that adding back oxygen to normoxic conditions did not completely alleviate gene expression changes in hypobaric responses.","title":"Dissecting Low Atmospheric Pressure Stress: Transcriptome Responses to the Components of Hypobaria in Arabidopsis [Experiment 2] - nasa_genelab_GLDS-136_but4-hnt9","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-136","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Dissecting Low Atmospheric Pressure Stress: Transcriptome Responses to the Components of Hypobaria in Arabidopsis [Experiment 2]"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/murine-microenvironment-metaprofiles-associate-with-human-cancer-etiology-and-intrinsic-su","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid extraction protocol","p-gse42742-2","p-gse42742-1","array scanning protocol","p-gse42742-7","p-gse42742-5","p-gse42742-4","nucleic acid hybridization","p-gse42742-3","sample collection","p-gse42742-6","sample treatment protocol","variation","labeling","normalization data transformation"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-79_bv3x-9itz","description":"We developed a mouse model that captures radiation effects on host biology by transplanting unirradiated Trp53 null mammary tissue to sham or irradiated hosts. Gene expression profiles of tumors that arose in irradiated mice are distinct from those that arose in naive hosts. Host irradiation induces a metaprofile consisting of gene modules representing stem cells cell motility macrophages and autophagy. Human orthologs of the host irradiation metaprofile discriminated between radiation-preceded and sporadic human thyroid cancers. An irradiated host centroid was strongly associated with estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. When applied to sporadic human breast cancers the irradiated host metaprofile strongly associated with basal-like and claudin-low breast cancer intrinsic subtypes. Comparing host irradiation in the context of TGFB levels showed that inflammation was robustly associated with claudin-low tumors. The association of the irradiated host metaprofiles with estrogen receptor negative status and claudin-low subtype suggests that host processes similar to those induced by radiation underlie sporadic cancers. Total RNA was extracted from mammary tumors derived from transplantations of non-irradiated p53null mammary fragments into irradiated hosts. We analyized a total of 32 p53null tumors from irradiated wild type mice: 9 from sham-irradiated hosts and 23 from irradiated hosts.

Microarray analysis revealed that C. albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 454 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.4% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to more normal bipolar budding patterns for ground samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, downregulation of genes involved in the actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested, as this regulator is involved in random budding, cell aggregation, actin cytoskeleton, and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. albicans. While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed. This study represents an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during spaceflight missions. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the general public. Cells were grown for 24 hours on the space shuttle or as ground-based controls, preserved in RNALater, and stored at -80C. Four samples of each flight- and ground-based controls were harvested for microarray analysis. GAP is Group Activation Pack and each GAP contains 8 FPAs. The numbers represent the # assigned to the particular GAP and the number assigned to the specific FPA (1-8) within the indicated GAP.

In this study we performed whole lung C-ion irradiation using three different strains of mice to examine whether strain-dependent differences in radiation effects occur in high-LET C-ion thoracic irradiation. Murine strain-variance was evaluated by histopathological examination of intra-alveolar hemorrhage that is likely to occur during the early phase after irradiation and of lung fibrosis during the late phase occurring more than three months after irradiation. We also performed microarray analysis to identify the key genes that are differentially regulated in different mouse strains after C-ion irradiation and to determine the mechanism of strain-dependent pulmonary damage after high-LET C-ion irradiation. Eight-week old female inbred C3H/He Slc C57BL/6J Jms Slc and A/J Jms Slc mice (3 kinds of mice) were used. The whole thorax of three mice was locally irradiated at 10 Gy with C-ion beams with a reference beam 137Cs gamma-rays (2 kinds of beam). Three mice of each strain (3 mice) were sacrificed and immediately dissected for lung extraction at 6 h (6h sample). Lungs for three mice of each strain without irradiation were extracted at the same time as control samples (control sample). Hybridization to microarrays (Whole Mouse Genome 4x44K OligoMicroarray Kit single color Cyamine 3-CTP) consisting of 44,000 total spots was conducted using an Agilent Gene Expression hybridization kit. The arrays from three independent replicates for each sample (3 arrays) were scanned on an Agilent dual-laser Microarray Scanner (all from Agilent Technologies) following the manufacturer  s instructions. A total of 108 samples were analyzed. 3 replicate arrays x 3 mice x 3 strains x 2 timing for sampling x 2 kinds of beam.","title":"Gene expression profiles of irradiated lung tissue in three mouse strains - nasa_genelab_GLDS-93_c7y4-mjyr","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-93","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Gene expression profiles of irradiated lung tissue in three mouse strains"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/biomolecule-sequencer-nasagenelabglds-84c996-z6hv","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["library construction","nucleic acid extraction","nucleic acid sequencing","sample collection","sequence assembly","microgravity"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-84_c996-z6hv","description":"Technology demonstration of a nanopore sequencer operating aboard the ISS in comparison with the same sequencer on the ground.","title":"Biomolecule Sequencer - nasa_genelab_GLDS-84_c996-z6hv","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-84","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Biomolecule Sequencer"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/spatially-resolved-transcriptional-analysis-of-brains-from-mice-flown-on-the-rr-3-mission","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["library construction","cryosection","mouse habitation","nucleic acid extraction","nucleic acid sequencing","sample collection","spaceflight","animal husbandry"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-352_cbgi-2a52","description":"The Rodent Research-3 (RR-3) mission was sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Co. and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space to study the effectiveness of a potential countermeasure for the loss of muscle and bone mass that occurs during spaceflight.

Twenty mice of similar age and matching sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Basal controls were housed in standard vivarium cages. Spaceflight ground controls and basal groups had blood collected then were euthanized had one hind limb removed and finally whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until dissection. All mice in this data set received only the control/sham injection. Brain samples from three flight and three ground control animal groups were cut in half between hemispheres. One hemisphere of each brain was used for generating spatially resolved transcriptional profiling data. Hemispheres were cryosectioned so that 2 consecutive sections from the hippocampus of each brain was placed on Visium Gene Expression arrays. Samples were fixed stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and imaged. Imaging was followed by tissue permeabilization to release mRNA molecules from cells for capture onto the array surface. Subsequently following the 10XGenomics Visium Gene Expression protocol Spatial Transcriptomics RNA-seq libraries were prepared and sequenced.","title":"Spatially resolved transcriptional analysis of brains from mice flown on the RR-3 mission","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-352","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Spatially resolved transcriptional analysis of brains from mice flown on the RR-3 mission"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/response-of-mammary-tissue-to-high-let-hze-particle-silicon-ions-radiation-or-low-let-gamm","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid hybridization","normalization data transformation","labeling protocol","ionizing radiation","growth protocol","genelab microarray data processing protocol","dose","data transformation","time","array scanning protocol","sample treatment protocol","rna extraction","p-gse48392-7","p-gse48392-6","p-gse48392-5","p-gse48392-4","p-gse48392-3","p-gse48392-2","p-gse48392-1"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-80_cd4u-zsms","description":"Transcriptional profiling of mammary tissue irradiated at 10 weeks of age with either 100 cGy sparsely ionizing gamma-rays or 10 cGy or 30 cGy densely ionizing radiation (350 MeV/amu Si).

Since access to medical expertise on such a mission is limited at best early diagnosis and mitigation of such exposure is critical. In order to accurately determine the dosage within 1 hour post-exposure dose-dependent biomarkers are needed. Therefore we performed a dose-course transcriptional analysis for radiation exposure at 0 0.3 1.5 and 3.0 Gy with corresponding time point at 1 hour (hr) post-exposure using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST v1 Array chips. The analysis of our data suggests a set of sensitive genetic biomarkers specific to each radiation level as well as generic radiation response biomarkers. Upregulated biomarkers can then be used within lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems to detect exposure to ionizing radiation. A total of sixteen human samples representing radiation exposure at levels 0 Gy 0.3 Gy 1.5 Gy and 3.0 Gy at time point 1 hour (hr) post-exposure were constructed. Blood samples were extracted from four human volunteers and were irradiated. Leukocytes were extracted and gene expression was measured. Samples for all four volunteers were measured at 1 hr for all four dose levels resulting in four replicates at each dose level. Thus a total of 4 samples at each of the four radiation levels were sampled yielding the total of 16 samples.","title":"Immediate Transcriptional Changes in Response to High Dose Radiation Exposure - nasa_genelab_GLDS-71_ch3f-w7ex","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-71","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Immediate Transcriptional Changes in Response to High Dose Radiation Exposure"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/calipso-lidar-l2-5-km-cloud-layer-data-v2-01","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"2006-03-01/2008-09-13","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["aerosol","climate","cloud","eos","radiation","satellite","atmospheric science"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"John M.

The environmental samples were collected with the polyester wipes from eight different locations in the ISS during two consecutive sampling sessions (three months apart). The specific objective was to unveil the pool of genes for each location during two separate sessions to learn of functional and metabolic diversity of microorganisms in the ISS. The International Space Station (ISS) as a closed built environment has its own environmental microbiome which is shaped by microgravity radiation and limited human presence. The microbial diversity associated with ISS environmental surfaces was investigated during this study. Polyester wipes and contact slides were used for sampling of eight various surface locations on the ISS at different time periods. The samples were retrieved and analyzed immediately upon the return to the Earth (via Soyuz TMA-14M or Dragon capsule from SpaceX). After surface sample collection contact slides containing nutrient media for the growth of bacteria and fungi were incubated at 25 xcb x9aC. The polyester wipes were processed to measure microbial burden (R2A Blood Agar and Potato Dextrose Agar) and recover cultivable bacteria as well as fungi. Subsequently viable microbial burden was assessed using Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods after propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment. The 16S-tag and metagenome analyses were used to elucidate viable microbial diversity. The cultivable bacterial population yield from the polyester wipes was very high (5 to 7-logs) when compared with the contact slides (102 to 103 CFU/m2). The PMA-qPCR analysis showed considerable variation of viable bacterial population (105 to 109 16S rDNA gene copies/m2) among locations sampled. Unlike contact slides polyester wipes cover much larger sample surface (~1 m2) and produce much more reliable results of the microbial diversity of the ISS covering both cultivable and non-cultivable species. The cultivable total and viable microbial diversity was determined utilizing state-of-the art molecular techniques. The implementation of the PMA assay before DNA extraction allowed distinguishing viable microorganisms which is crucial for determining their role to the crew health the ISS maintenance and the general knowledge of the closed environmentally controlled built systems.","title":"Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO): Indoor microbiome study of the International Space Station surfaces - nasa_genelab_GLDS-69_ckj7-3p9q","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-69","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO): Indoor microbiome study of the International Space Station surfaces"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/small-satellite-power-simulation","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2023-11-02","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-11-02","keyword":["diagnostics","degradation","batteries","prognostics","phm"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Chetan Kulkarni","hasEmail":"mailto:chetan.s.kulkarni@nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"PCoE"},"identifier":"cpqc-ztjh","description":"Data collected from the simulated experiments on small satellite BP930 batteries using the MACCOR system.","title":"Small Satellite Power Simulation","programCode":["026:001"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.nasa.gov/download/cpqc-ztjh/application/zip","mediaType":"application/zip"}],"license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","theme":["Raw Data"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/mouse-fecal-microbiome-after-exposure-to-high-let-radiation-nasagenelabglds-146cq53-ke34","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["timepoint","dose","nucleic acid extraction","nucleic acid sequencing","sample collection","library construction","irradiation"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-146_cq53-ke34","description":"Space travel is associated with continuous low-dose-rate exposure to high Linear Energy Transfer (LET) radiation.

Researchers have been investigating various tools to analyze these types of interactions. In particular gene co-expression network methods have proved useful in finding and analyzing these molecular interactions. Many different analytical pipelines to identify these interactions networks have been proposed with the aim of identifying an optimal partition of the network where the individual modules are neither too small to make any general inference or too large to be biologically interpretable. Results: In this study we propose a new pipeline to perform gene co-expression network analysis. The proposed pipeline uses WGCNA a widely used software to perform different aspects of gene co-expression network analysis and modularity maximization algorithm to analyze novel RNA-Seq data to understand the effects of low-dose 56Fe ion irradiation on the formation of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. The network results along with experimental validation show that using WGCNA combined with Modularity provide a more biologically interpretable network in our dataset. Our pipeline showed better performance than the existing clustering algorithm in WGCNA in finding modules and identified a module with mitochondrial subunits that are supported by mitochondrial complex assay. Conclusions: We present a pipeline that can reduce the problem of parameter selection with the existing algorithm in WGCNA for comparable RNA-Seq datasets which may assist in future research to discover novel mRNA interactions and their downstream molecular effects. C57BL16 males were placed into 2 treatment groups and received the following irradiation treatments at Brookhaven National Laboratories (Long Island NY): 600 MeV/n 56Fe (0.2 Gy) and no irradiation. Left liver lobes were collected at 30 60 120 270 and 360 days post-irradiation flash frozen and stored at -80 xc2 xb0C until they could be processed for RNA-Seq. Livers were sampled by taking two 40-micron thick slices using a cryotome at -20 xc2 xb0C. This allowed multiple sampling of the tissue without the tissue going through multiple freeze/thaw cycles. Total RNA was isolated from the liver slices using RNAqueousTM Total RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific Waltham MA) and rRNA was removed via Ribo-ZeroTM rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina San Diego CA) prior to library preparation with the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library kit. Samples were sequenced in a paired-end 50 base format on an Illumina HiSeq 1500. Reads were aligned to the mouse GRCm38 reference genome using the STAR alignment program version 2.5.3a with the recommended ENCODE options. The -quantMode GeneCounts option was used to obtain read counts per gene based on the Gencode release M14 annotation file. Total number of reads used in analysis varies between 23-35 millions of reads.","title":"Efficient Identification of Multiple Pathways: RNA-Seq Analysis of Livers from 56Fe Ion Irradiated Mice","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-294","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Efficient Identification of Multiple Pathways: RNA-Seq Analysis of Livers from 56Fe Ion Irradiated Mice"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/equipotential-shape-models-for-the-gas-giants","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2020-01-15","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2024-05-15","keyword":["juno","jupiter","saturn","cassini"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Dustin Buccino","hasEmail":"mailto:dustin.r.buccino@jpl.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Dustin Buccino"},"identifier":"d89d-hsyb","description":"This dataset contains geopotential shape models of Jupiter and Saturn derived from the high-precision gravitational field models produced by the Juno mission to Jupiter and Cassini's Grand Finale at Saturn.

Thus it is important to understand their global responses to long-term exposure to space or Mars environments. As part of the PROTECT experiment spores of B. subtilis 168 were exposed to real space conditions and to simulated martian conditions for 559 days in low Earth orbit mounted on the EXPOSE-E exposure platform outside the European Columbus module on the International Space Station. Upon return spores were germinated total RNA extracted and fluorescently labeled and used to probe a custom Bacillus subtilis microarray to identify genes preferentially activated or repressed relative to ground control spores. Increased transcript levels were detected for a number of stress-related regulons responding to DNA damage (SOS response SP-beta prophage induction) protein damage (CtsR/Clp system) oxidative stress (PerR regulon) and cell envelope stress (SigV regulon). Spores exposed to space demonstrated a much broader and more severe stress response than spores exposed to simulated Mars conditions. The results are discussed in the context of planetary protection for a hypothetical journey of potential forward contaminant spores from Earth to Mars and their subsequent residence on Mars. Two-color microarrays were performed comparing germination of Space-exposed or Mars-exposed vs. ground-control (Earth) spores.","title":"Bacillus subtilis spores PROTECT experiment Space-exposed and Mars-exposed vs. Earth-control - nasa_genelab_GLDS-28_dgmm-uid9","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-28","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Bacillus subtilis spores PROTECT experiment Space-exposed and Mars-exposed vs. Earth-control"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/tropospheric-emission-spectrometer-tes-data","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["global warming","ozone","eos","stratosphere","sun","water vapor","climate change","climate","oceans","nitrogen dioxide","greenhouse gases","methane","carbon monoxide","atmosphere","biosphere","aura","nitric acid","eyes on the earth"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Scott Gluck","hasEmail":"mailto:scott.gluck@jpl.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000113","description":"TES focuses on the troposphere, the layer of atmosphere that stretches from the ground to the altitude at which airplanes fly.

The feasibility of using tiny root sections for transcriptome analysis was examined in this study. To understand the gene expression profiles of the root apex Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 roots were sectioned into Zone-I (0.5 mm root cap and meristematic zone) and Zone-II (1.5 mm transition elongation and growth terminating zone). Gene expression was analyzed using microarray and RNA seq. Both the techniques arrays and RNA-Seq identified 4180 common genes as differentially expressed (with > two-fold changes) between the zones. In addition 771 unique genes and 19 novel TARs were identified by RNA-Seq as differentially expressed which were not detected in the arrays. Single root tip zones can be used for full transcriptome analysis; further the root apex zones are functionally very distinct from each other. RNA-Seq provided novel information about the transcripts compared to the arrays. These data will help optimize transcriptome techniques for dealing with small rare samples.","title":"Comparative gene expression analysis in the Arabidopsis thaliana root apex using RNA-seq and microarray transcriptome profiles","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-208","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Comparative gene expression analysis in the Arabidopsis thaliana root apex using RNA-seq and microarray transcriptome profiles"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/proteomics-and-transcriptomics-analysis-of-arabidopsis-seedlings-in-microgravity-nasagenel","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid sequencing","gravity","labeling","library construction","mass spectrometry","space flight","sequence analysis data transformation","sample collection","protein extraction","preservation method","nucleic acid extraction"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-38_dmhv-stg2","description":"On Earth plants are constantly exposed to a gravitational field of 1g. Gravity affects a plant in every step of its development. Germinating seedlings orient their radicle and hypocotyl and growing plants position organs at a specific Gravitropic Set-point Angle dictated by the asymmetric distribution of auxin depending on the gravity vector. Hence gravitropism is one of the fundamental growth responses in plants. For any experiment studying the effects of gravity on plants the ultimate control is the microgravity in space. In this study Arabidopsis seeds were flown to the International Space Station and allowed to germinate and grow for 3 days in microgravity. Arabidopsis Wild Type Col-0 seeds were plated onto twenty-two 60mm Petri plates loaded into PDFUs and inserted 4 Biological Research in Canisters (BRICs). Approximately 800 seeds were sterilized plated on each 60mm Petri plates and cold stratified for 16 hours followed by 2 hours of white light treatment. The BRICs were maintained at 4C until spaceflight to ensure seed germination in microgravity. After 3 days of germination and growth the seedlings were fixed by injecting RNAlater into the chamber. They were kept at ambient temperature for 12 hours followed by freezing at -80C. An additional 22 plates were used as ground controls. After the spaceflight tissue from five plates was pooled to make each of three replicates. Both membrane and soluble proteins were extracted from the pooled seedlings. Proteins were trypsin digested labelled with iTRAQ and identified using tandem mass spectrometry.","title":"Proteomics and Transcriptomics analysis of Arabidopsis Seedlings in Microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-38_dmhv-stg2","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-38","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Proteomics and Transcriptomics analysis of Arabidopsis Seedlings in Microgravity"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gazetteer-of-planetary-nomenclature-nasa-00000389","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1977-01-01/2014-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["geography","space science","wise","nen"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Jennifer Blue","hasEmail":"mailto:jblue@usgs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000038__9","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

CRESS was designed as a secondary payload for the December 2016 high-altitude high-latitude and long-duration balloon flight carrying the Boron And Carbon Cosmic Rays in the Upper Stratosphere (BACCUS) experimental hardware. Investigation of the biological effects of Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) particularly those of ions with High-Z and Energy (HZE) is of interest due to the genomic damage this type of radiation inflicts. The biological effects of upper-stratospheric mixed radiation above Antarctica (ANT) were sampled using Arabidopsis thaliana seeds and were compared to those resulting from a controlled simulation of GCR at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and to laboratory control seed. The payload developed for Antarctica exposure was broadly designed to 1U CubeSat specifications (10cmx10cmx10cm <1.33kg) maintained 1 atm internal pressure and carried an internal cargo of four seed trays (about 580,000 seeds) and twelve CR-39 Solid-State Nuclear Track Detectors (SSNTDs). The irradiated seeds were recovered sterilized and grown on Petri plates for phenotypic screening. BNL and ANT M0 seeds showed significantly reduced germination rates and elevated somatic mutation rates when compared to non-irradiated controls with the BNL mutation rate also being significantly higher than that of ANT. Genomic DNA from mutants of interest was evaluated with whole-genome sequencing using PacBio SMRT technology.

BMSC were grown in porous bioceramic Skelite disks (dia 9 mm x T 1.2 mm). The constructs were exposed to microgravity for ca. 8 days then fixed for RNA extraction. While the flight experiment was performed in fully automated hardware inside the KUBIK incubator one group of control samples were incubated inside manually operated hardwares (flight control) and the other control group was incubated under routine laboratory conditions (lab control). The altered gene expression profile was analyzed by Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix) representing whole-transcript coverage. Each one of the 28853 genes is represented on the array by approximately 26 probes spread across the full length of the gene providing a more complete and more accurate picture of gene expression than the 3   based expression array design. A few days of microgravity were sufficient to determinate at least at the molecular level an effect in the BMSC; this response expressed a stress condition able to determinate consequences on several compartments and cellular functions. In particular it seems to promote a gene expression known to be associated with neurogenic activity (e.g. axon guidance) perhaps promoting the BMSC capability to be committed in that direction. The osteo-induction by dexamethasone-based medium due to the short duration of stimulation did not have the possibility to manifest itself at the phenotypic level but only partially at the molecular level.","title":"Genechip analysis of bone marrow osteoprogenitors exposed to microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-29_e82r-sxqj","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-29","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Genechip analysis of bone marrow osteoprogenitors exposed to microgravity"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/microbiological-and-nutritional-analysis-of-lettuce-crops-grown-on-the-international-space","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["spaceflight","sample collection","organism part","nucleic acid sequencing-its","nucleic acid sequencing-16s","library construction","nucleic acid sequencing","nucleic acid extraction","library construction-its","library construction-16s"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-267_e846-75g3","description":"Lettuce crops grown in the Veggie payload aboard ISS harvested and returned for chemical microbiological and molecular analysis","title":"Microbiological and nutritional analysis of lettuce crops grown on the International Space Station-VEG01A","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-267","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Microbiological and nutritional analysis of lettuce crops grown on the International Space Station-VEG01A"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/microbial-observatory-iss-mo-antimicrobial-resistance-genes-nasagenelabglds-66e94p-rvxg","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["sample processing","sequence analysis data transformation","library construction","spaceflight","nucleic acid sequencing","sample collection"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-66_e94p-rvxg","description":"The environmental samples were collected with the polyester wipes from eight different locations in the International Space Station (ISS) during two consecutive sampling sessions (three months apart) within the ISS Microbial Observatory Experiment. DNA extracted from each of the samples was used to create amplicon libraries based on customized panel of 500 antimicrobial resistance genes followed by next-generation sequencing. This is the first study of that shows the reservoir of antimicrobial genes in the ISS. The International Space Station (ISS) as a closed built environment has its own environmental microbiome which is shaped by microgravity radiation and limited human presence. The microbial diversity associated with ISS environmental surfaces was investigated during this study. Polyester wipes and contact slides were used for sampling of eight various surface locations on the ISS at different time periods. The samples were retrieved and analyzed immediately upon the return to the Earth (via Soyuz TMA-14M or Dragon capsule from SpaceX). After surface sample collection contact slides containing nutrient media for the growth of bacteria and fungi were incubated at 25 xcb x9aC. The polyester wipes were processed to measure microbial burden (R2A Blood Agar and Potato Dextrose Agar) and recover cultivable bacteria as well as fungi. Subsequently viable microbial burden was assessed using Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods after propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment. The 16S-tag and metagenome analyses were used to elucidate viable microbial diversity. The cultivable bacterial population yield from the polyester wipes was very high (5 to 7-logs) when compared with the contact slides (102 to 103 CFU/m2). The PMA-qPCR analysis showed considerable variation of viable bacterial population (105 to 109 16S rDNA gene copies/m2) among locations sampled. Unlike contact slides polyester wipes cover much larger sample surface (~1 m2) and produce much more reliable results of the microbial diversity of the ISS covering both cultivable and non-cultivable species. The cultivable total and viable microbial diversity was determined utilizing state-of-the art molecular techniques. The implementation of the PMA assay before DNA extraction allowed distinguishing viable microorganisms which is crucial for determining their role to the crew health the ISS maintenance and the general knowledge of the closed environmentally controlled built systems.","title":"Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO): Antimicrobial resistance genes - nasa_genelab_GLDS-66_e94p-rvxg","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-66","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO): Antimicrobial resistance genes"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gazetteer-of-planetary-nomenclature-nasa-000003819","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1977-01-01/2014-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["nen","space science","wise","geography"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Jennifer Blue","hasEmail":"mailto:jblue@usgs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000038__19","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

Presumably extraterrestrial infection may trigger potentially novel bionetworks different from the terrestrial equivalent which could only be probed by investigating the host-pathogen relationship with minimum terrestrial bias. Towards this objective we strategically engineered a cell culture module equipped with a feedback controlled semi-automated platform to expose human endothelial cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The assay was carried out in the STS-135 space shuttle and a concurrent ground study constituted the baseline. Transcriptomic investigation revealed an immune blunting in microgravity; Lbp MyD88 and MD-2 failed to encode proteins responsible for early LPS uptake. Longer exposure results implied that there was a delayed response potentially ineffectual in preventing pathogens from opportunistically modulating the infection network. Lack of recruitment of growth factors and a debilitated apoptosome supported this potential explanation. Certain cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 surged in response to LPS insult in microgravity. Contrasting expressions of B2M TIMP-1 and VEGRs suggested impaired pro-survival adaptation and healing mechanisms. The susceptibility of oxidative stress and immune regulation to microgravity compelled further investigation of the respective microRNA modulators such as miR-200a and miR-146b. These miRNAs were expressed differently in response to LPS assaults in different gravitational limits. In conclusion despite a serious drawback attributed to the small sample size we delineated some of the important aspects of the extraterrestrial etiology; more comprehensive follow up studies are warranted. Present study though compromised by the small sample size was able to shade lights on several aspects of immunological responses to the endotoxic assault mediated by uG. Implementing the host-pathogen interactions in the spaceflight and subsequently lysing the cells onboard presented the critical distinguishing features of the present study from the past reports. We identified the CCM of Tissue Genesis Inc. HI as the suitable hardware system to carry out the experiment in the spaceflight. CCM is an automated feedback controlled module that can concurrently support 24 bioreactors following protocols exclusively programmed for individual bioreactor. For this experiment we use samples EA41 EA 47 EA45 and EA155 that were exposed to LPS for 4 hours. Samples EA123 EA165 EA127 EA126 were exposed to LPS for 8Hrs. Samples EA33 EA 125 EA79 and EA 39 were controls in this experiment.","title":"Immune responses to the in vitro LPS assault engineered in the spaceflight multi-omics study - nasa_genelab_GLDS-54_eca5-kixu","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-54","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Immune responses to the in vitro LPS assault engineered in the spaceflight multi-omics study"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/randomized-battery-usage-3-room-temperature-variable-recharge-random-walk","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2022-10-20","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2022-10-20","keyword":["prognostics","phm","degradation","batteries"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Christopher Teubert","hasEmail":"mailto:Christopher.A.Teubert@nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"PCoE"},"identifier":"ed33-vxp2","description":"This dataset is part of a series of datasets, where batteries are continuously cycled with randomly generated current profiles.

However hydrated magnesium sulfate mineral levels in the regolith of Mars can reach as high as 10 wt% and would be expected to be highly inhibitory to plant growth. A global approach was used to identify novel genes with potential to enhance tolerance to high MgSO4 stress. The early Arabidopsis root transcriptome response to elevated concentrations of magnesium sulfate was characterized in col-0 and also between col-0 and the mutant line cax1-1 - a mutant relatively tolerant of high levels of MgSO4-7H2O in soil solution. After 3 weeks of growth under hydroponic conditions Arabidopsis thaliana col-0 roots were exposed to a basic nutrient solution (0.25 g/L MES 1/16x MS pH 5.7) with an additional 2.08 mM magnesium sulfate (total Ca:Mg ratio = 1:15) for 45 min. 90 min. or 180 min. while a col-0 control set was exposed to the basic nutrient solution without additional magnesium sulfate for 45 minutes. Arabidopsis thaliana cax1-1 roots were exposed to the basic nutrient solution with additional magnesium sulfate for 180 min. only. Four replicate containers were harvested for the control and each of the treatment sets resulting in a total of 20 samples. Gene expression of the col-0 sets exposed to magnesium sulfate treatment for 45 min. 90 min. or 180 min. was compared to gene expression of the col-0 control set. Gene expression of the cax1-1 set exposed to magnesium sulfate treatment for 180 min. was compared to gene expression of the col-0 set exposed to magnesium sulfate treatment for 180 minutes.","title":"Root transcriptome remodeling of Arabidopsis in response to high levels of magnesium sulfate - nasa_genelab_GLDS-22_ef88-sg27","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-22","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Root transcriptome remodeling of Arabidopsis in response to high levels of magnesium sulfate"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/mirna-signature-detection-and-countermeasures-against-hze-radiation-exposure-for-tissue-de","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid extraction","nucleic acid sequencing","ionizing radiation","library construction","hindlimb unloading","treatment protocol"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-335_efpb-rfsr","description":"Biological risks associated with space radiation and microgravity are major concerns for long-term space travel. Through a Systems Biology approach our previous NASA work has shown both TGF xce xb2 signaling pathways and miRNAs have a critical impact on defining health risks with and without space irradiation. We hypothesize that circulating microRNA (miRNA) signatures are driving microvascular disease and muscle degeneration associated with accelerating aging and will be enhanced by exposure to the space environment (radiation and microgravity). We investigated this hypothesis both in vivo and in vitro and test novel antagonist therapies to these miRNA signatures as countermeasures to reduce space radiation-induced health risks. A comprehensive Systems Biology approach was used to examine the influence by high atomic number by high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) (HZE) irradiation. To simulate low-dose exposure due to galactic cosmic rays (GCR) we used the ions energy and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula of 7 different ions to represent GCR (referred to as GCR sim model). To simulate high-dose radiation exposure due to solar particle events (SPE) we used an acute dose of SPE simulated beam at 1Gy which has energies ranging from 50MeV to 150MeV. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were utilized for irradiation with our established simulated microgravity model (hindlimb suspension model) and an in vitro 3D microvasculature tissue model under simulated microgravity (clinostat) conditions will also be irradiated. To expand on the circulating miRNA signature determined from our preliminary data we determined a group of conserved miRNAs which are commonly being regulated in the majority of the organs and tissues throughout the host using our established techniques. MiRNA-sequencing on serum (before IR and at time of sacrifice) liver heart and muscle tissue for all radiation groups revealed the key circulating miRNA signature (consisting of multiple miRNAs) impacting disease risk. Collectively understanding of how whole body space radiation impacts microvascular and tissue degeneration through circulating miRNAs will greatly enhance health risk prognostication and provide possible new mechanisms for protection against space radiation.","title":"miRNA signature detection and countermeasures against HZE radiation exposure for tissue degeneration-Liver tissue","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-335","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"miRNA signature detection and countermeasures against HZE radiation exposure for tissue degeneration-Liver tissue"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/mars-orbital-image-hirise-labeled-data-set-version-3","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2020-01-22","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-31","keyword":["machine-learning","usg-artificial-intelligence","planetary science","usg-ai-training-data","mars reconnaissance orbiter","hirise"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"NA","hasEmail":"mailto:nasa-data@lists.arc.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"NASA JPL"},"identifier":"egmv-36wq","description":"This data set contains a total of 73,031 landmarks. 10,433 landmarks were detected and extracted from 180 HiRISE browse images, and 62,598 landmarks were augmented from 10,433 original landmarks.

B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly diversified receptors known as immunoglobulins (Ig) that directly bind and neutralize pathogens. Ig diversity is achieved through the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA of each B cell in a host. The collection of Ig specificities within a host or Ig repertoire has been increasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS). We utilized HTS to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals however gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and Ig xce xba gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that space flight did not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time.","title":"Effects of spaceflight on the immunoglobulin repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6 mice - nasa_genelab_GLDS-164_eh5s-w47p","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-164","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Effects of spaceflight on the immunoglobulin repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6 mice"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/calipso-imaging-infrared-radiometer-l2-data-track-v3-30","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"2013-02-01/2014-06-05","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["aerosol","satellite","eos","climate","radiation","atmospheric science","cloud"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"John M.

Under the Rodent Research Program of NASA we assayed the genomic and metabolomics perturbations in the quadriceps of C57BL/6j male mice that lived on the spaceflight (FLT) or at Ground Control (CTR) for approximately four weeks. Wet weight of quadriceps were significantly reduced in FLT mice. Deep next generation sequencing and untargeted mass spectroscopic assay interrogated the gene-metabolite landscape of same tissues. A majority of top ranked differentially suppressed genes in FLT encode proteins from myosin or troponin family suggesting a sarcomere alteration in space. Significantly enriched gene-metabolite networks were found linked to saromeric integrity immune fitness and oxidative stress response; all inhibited in space as per in silico prediction. A significant loss of FLT mitochondrial DNA copy numbers underlined the energy deprivation associated with spaceflight induced stress and this hypothesis was reinforced by the omics analysis that showed inhibited networks related to protein lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. Finally we reported a list of upstream regulators which could be targeted for next generation therapeutic intervention for the betterment of the musculoskeletal system in male mice subjected to chronic disuse.","title":"Gene-metabolite network linked to inhibited bioenergetics in association with spaceflight induced loss of quadriceps muscle","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-326","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Gene-metabolite network linked to inhibited bioenergetics in association with spaceflight induced loss of quadriceps muscle"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/expression-data-from-sphinx-spaceflight-of-huvec-an-integrated-experiment-nasagenelabglds-","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["p-gse43582-3","genelab microarray data processing protocol","p-gse43582-2","feature_extraction","hybridization","data transformation","p-gse43582-7","p-gse43582-8","image_aquisition","labeling","spaceflight","specified_biomaterial_action","nucleic_acid_extraction","grow","p-gse43582-1","bioassay_data_transformation","p-gse43582-6","p-gse43582-5","p-gse43582-4"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-52_fabx-vs3c","description":"Changes in the physical environment modulate cell responses and may lead to the impairment or even failure of tissue function as a result of mechanotransduction processes.

Each engine starts with different degrees of initial wear and manufacturing variation which is unknown to the user. This wear and variation is considered normal, i.e., it is not considered a fault condition. There are three operational settings that have a substantial effect on engine performance. These settings are also included in the data. The data is contaminated with sensor noise.\n\nThe engine is operating normally at the start of each time series, and develops a fault at some point during the series. In the training set, the fault grows in magnitude until system failure. In the test set, the time series ends some time prior to system failure.

There were two primary objectives for this experiment: (1) Demonstrate all post-flight processes and operations required for successful completion of GeneLab Reference Missions conducted on ISS and (2) Generate high quality GeneLab Reference Mission omics data sets for two prokaryotic model organisms Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Freezing Control Experiment: The BRIC hardware has significant thermal inertia thus the freezing rate of samples placed at -80 C is quite slow. This could affect RNA-sequencing proteomic and metabolic data sets. In an effort to understand how slow freezing could affect these data sets a control experiment was designed in which B. subtilis and S. aureus were grown in petri plates and either slow frozen to -80 C at a rate matching the BRIC-23 spaceflight samples or processed immediately to harvest RNA and protein.

As a ubiquitous environmental organism that is occasionally part of the human flora Pseudomonas aeruginosa could pose a health hazard for the immuno-compromised astronauts. In order to gain insights in the behavior of P. aeruginosa in spaceflight conditions two spaceflight-analogue culture systems i.e. the rotating wall vessel (RWV) and the random position machine (RPM) were used. Microarray analysis of P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown in the low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment of the RWV compared to the normal gravity control (NG) revealed a regulatory role for AlgU (RpoE). Specifically P. aeruginosa cultured in LSMMG exhibited increased alginate production and up-regulation of AlgU-controlled transcripts including those encoding stress-related proteins. This study also shows the involvement of Hfq in the LSMMG response consistent with its previously identified role in the Salmonella LSMMG- and spaceflight response. Furthermore cultivation in LSMMG increased heat and oxidative stress resistance and caused a decrease in the culture oxygen transfer rate. Interestingly the global transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa grown in the RPM was similar to that in NG. The possible role of differences in fluid mixing between the RWV and RPM is discussed with the overall collective data favoring the RWV as the optimal model to study the LSMMG-response of suspended cells. This study represents a first step towards the identification of specific virulence mechanisms of P. aeruginosa activated in response to spaceflight-analogue conditions and could direct future research regarding the risk assessment and prevention of Pseudomonas infections for the crew in flight and the general public.","title":"Response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to low shear modeled microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-14_fg6b-h7es","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-14","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to low shear modeled microgravity"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gazetteer-of-planetary-nomenclature-nasa-00000384","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1977-01-01/2014-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["nen","wise","geography","space science"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Jennifer Blue","hasEmail":"mailto:jblue@usgs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000038__4","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

A global approach was used to identify novel genes with potential to enhance tolerance to high MgSO4 stress. The early Arabidopsis root transcriptome response to elevated concentrations of magnesium sulfate was characterized in col-0 and also between col-0 and the mutant line cax1-1 - a mutant relatively tolerant of high levels of MgSO4-7H2O in soil solution. After 3 weeks of growth under hydroponic conditions Arabidopsis thaliana col-0 roots were exposed to a basic nutrient solution (0.25 g/L MES 1/16x MS pH 5.7) with an additional 2.08 mM magnesium sulfate (total Ca:Mg ratio = 1:15) for 45 min. 90 min. or 180 min. while a col-0 control set was exposed to the basic nutrient solution without additional magnesium sulfate for 45 minutes.

Gravity affects a plant in every step of its development. Germinating seedlings orient their radicle and hypocotyl and growing plants position organs at a specific Gravitropic Set-point Angle dictated by the asymmetric distribution of auxin depending on the gravity vector. Hence gravitropism is one of the fundamental growth responses in plants. For any experiment studying the effects of gravity on plants the ultimate control is the microgravity in space. In this study Arabidopsis seeds were flown to the International Space Station and allowed to germinate and grow for 3 days in microgravity. Arabidopsis Wild Type Col-0 seeds were plated onto twenty-two 60mm Petri plates loaded into PDFUs and inserted 4 Biological Research in Canisters (BRICs). Approximately 800 seeds were sterilized plated on each 60mm Petri plates and cold stratified for 16 hours followed by 2 hours of white light treatment. The BRICs were maintained at 4C until spaceflight to ensure seed germination in microgravity. After 3 days of germination and growth the seedlings were fixed by injecting RNAlater into the chamber. They were kept at ambient temperature for 12 hours followed by freezing at -80C. An additional 22 plates were used as ground controls. After the spaceflight tissue from five plates was pooled to make each of three replicates. Both membrane and soluble proteins were extracted from the pooled seedlings. Proteins were trypsin digested labelled with iTRAQ and identified using tandem mass spectrometry.","title":"Proteomics and Transcriptomics analysis of Arabidopsis Seedlings in Microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-38_fnfa-skxy","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-38","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Proteomics and Transcriptomics analysis of Arabidopsis Seedlings in Microgravity"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/draft-genome-sequences-of-members-of-the-family-methylobacteriaceae-associated-with-the-in","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["['\"sample collection\"' '\"nucleic acid extraction\"' '\"library construction\"' '\"nucleic acid sequencing\"' '\"sequence assembly\"']","['\"spaceflight\"' '\"strain\"']"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-300_fptf-edwp","description":"['\"Draft Genome Sequences of isolates belonging to family Methylobacteriaceae Isolated from the International Space Station\"']","title":"['\"Draft Genome Sequences of Members of the family Methylobacteriaceae Associated with the International Space Station\"']","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-300","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"['\"Draft Genome Sequences of Members of the family Methylobacteriaceae Associated with the International Space Station\"']"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/international-space-station-conditions-alter-genomics-proteomics-and-metabolomics-in-asper","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["growth time","spaceflight","library construction","nucleic acid extraction","sample treatment","nucleic acid sequencing","strain","sample collection"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-233_fq84-y35b","description":"The first global genomic proteomic and secondary metabolomic characterization of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans following growth onboard the International Space Station (ISS) is reported.

In this paper the role of Flo1p in mating was demonstrated by showing that the mating efficiency which contributes to the increased survival rate as well by generating genetic variability is increased when cells flocculate. This was revealed by liquid growth experiments in a low shear environment and differential transcriptome analysis of FLO1 expressing cells compared to the non-flocculent wild-type cells. The results show that a floc provides a uniquely organized multicellular ultrastructure that provides a suitable microenvironment to induce and perform cell conjugation. S. cerevisiae strains BY4742 WT BY4742::FLO8 and BY4742 [FLO1] were grown in microgravity and 1-g. A transcriptomic analysis was performed and the transcriptome data were integrated with the high quality protein-protein interaction networks.

Additionally there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls but that the host immune system is not significantly altered amongst known immune genes. High-throughput sequencing of wild-type (w1118) adult hosts infected with either space or ground-reared S. marcescens revealed few changes in gene expression with 11 genes significantly differentially expressed (q-values <0.05) and only one gene related to the immune system. This data supports the main findings of the paper which state that both spaceflight and low-shear modeled microgravity conditions increase the virulence of this pathogen independent of the host immune system. This data which shows that there are no significant immune-related changes to the host when infected with space-grown sample compared to ground-grown sample provides further evidence that there are likely phenotypic changes to the pathogen itself that is causing increased virulence in spaceflight and in low-shear modeled microgravity. RNA was extracted in triplicate from 2 pooled adult (2-3 day old female) Drosophila melanogaster (w1118) per treatment with 4 total treatment groups (no injection control sham injection with PBS ground bacteria-injected and space bacteria-injected) with poly(A)+ RNA libraries.

The experiment involved an implantable subcutaneous nanochannel delivery system (nDS; between scapula) which delivered the drug formoterol (FMT; a selective Beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist) over the course of time. To this end a cohort of forty 32-weeks-old female C57BL/6NTac mice were either sham operated or implanted with vehicle or treatment-filled nDS launched in two Transporters (20 mice per Transporter) on SpaceX-13 on December 15 2017. They were transferred to Rodent Habitats onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and maintained in microgravity for 29 days (N=20 Live Animal Return [LAR]) or >50 days (N=20 ISS Terminal). After 29 days the 20 LAR animals were returned live to back to Earth on January 13 2018,. After splashdown the animals were ambulatory on-ground for ~4 days until all subjects were processed during one day of dissections. There were two Baseline groups of animals sacrificed (LAR Baseline & FLT Baseline; N=20; 40 animals; ~36 weeks old) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC; 12/9/17). A Ground Control group mimicked the Flight LAR group which was housed at KSC then shipped alive to Novartis   Facilities where both the LAR and LAR Ground Control groups were processed (~41 weeks old; 1/16/18). All were anesthetized with isoflurane blood samples were obtained by closed-chest cardiac puncture and the animals were euthanized by exsanguination and thoracotomy. The 20 ISS Terminal mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine over the course of a four days of dissections (2/6/18 until 2/9/18; 53-56 days after launch; 44 weeks old at time of on-orbit dissections). Blood samples and euthanasia were conducted the same as LAR and Baseline. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection the ISS-terminal animal carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return. The ISS-terminal Ground Controls (at KSC) followed the same euthanasia timeline methods and preservation. The final processing of frozen ISS-terminal frozen ISS-terminal Ground Controls and frozen 0-day FLT baseline animals were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute in Houston TX (5/21/18 until 5/24/18). GeneLab received samples of lung from only sham treated animals (no drug treated animals) from the following groups Flight: LAR (n=10) ISS Terminal (n= 10); Ground Controls: LAR GC (N=9) ISS Terminal GC (N=10) LAR Baseline (n=10) ISS Terminal Baseline (n=9).

Differential gene expression was analyzed in Tgfb1 heterozygote and wild type littermate 4th mammary glands after whole body exposure to an acute dose of 10cGy ionizing radiation. Estrus cycle was normalized in all mice two days prior to irradiation by injection with an estrogen and progesterone mixture. It is widely believed that the carcinogenic action of ionizing radiation is due to targeted DNA damage and resulting mutations but there is also substantial evidence that non-targeted radiation effects alter epithelial phenotype and the stromal microenvironment. Activation of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta) is a non-targeted radiation effect that mediates cell fate decisions following DNA damage and regulates microenvironment composition; it could either suppress or promote cancer. Gene expression profiling shown herein demonstrates that low dose radiation (10 cGy) elicits persistent changes in Tgfb1 wild type and heterozygote murine mammary gland that are highly modulated by TGFbeta. We asked if such non-targeted radiation effects contribute to carcinogenesis by using a novel radiation chimera model. Unirradiated Trp53 null mammary epithelium was transplanted to the mammary stroma of mice previously exposed to a single low (10 -100 cGy) radiation dose. By 300 days 100% of transplants in irradiated hosts at either 10 or 100 cGy had developed Trp53 null breast carcinomas compared to 54% in unirradiated hosts. Tumor growth rate was also increased by high but not low dose host irradiation. In contrast irradiation of Tgfb1 heterozygote mice prior to transplantation failed to decrease tumor latency or increase growth rate at any dose. Host irradiation significantly reduced the latency of invasive ductal carcinoma compared to spindle cell carcinoma as well as those tumors negative for smooth muscle actin in wild type but not Tgfb1 heterozygote mice. However irradiation of either host genotype significantly increased the frequency of estrogen receptor negative tumors. These data demonstrate two concepts critical to understanding radiation risks. First non-targeted radiation effects can significantly promote the frequency and alter the features of epithelial cancer. Second radiation-induced TGFbeta activity is a key mechanism of tumor promotion. Keywords: Differential gene expression after low dose irradiation Two genotypes: TGBbeta1 heterozygote and wildtype mouse mammary glands. Two time points post-10cGy-irradiation per genotype (1 week 4 weeks); control time point was 1 week post-sham-irradiation.

Interactions of meteorology with wildfires in British Columbia, Canada during August 2017 led to three major pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) events that resulted in the injection of large amounts of smoke aerosols and other combustion products at the local upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). These plumes of UTLS smoke with elevated values of aerosol extinction and backscatter compared to the background state were readily tracked by multiple satellite-based instruments as they spread across the Northern Hemisphere (NH). The plumes resided in the lower stratosphere for about 8-10 months following the fire injections. To investigate the radiative impacts of these events on the Earth system, we performed a number of simulations with the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). Observations from multiple remote-sensing instruments were used to calibrate the injection parameters (location, amount, composition, and heights) and optical properties of the smoke aerosols in the model. The resulting simulations of three-dimensional smoke transport were evaluated for a year from the day of injections using daily observations from OMPS-LP (Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite Limb Profiler). The model simulated rate of ascent, hemispheric spread, and residence time of the smoke aerosols in the stratosphere are in close agreement with OMPS-LP observations. We found that both aerosol self-lofting and the large-scale atmospheric motion play important roles in lifting the smoke plumes from near the tropopause altitudes (~12 km) to about 22-23 km into the atmosphere. Further, our estimations of the radiative impacts of the pyroCb-emitted smoke aerosols showed that the smoke caused additional warming of the atmosphere by about 0.6-1 W/m2 (zonal mean) that persisted for about 2-3 months after the injections in regions north of 40oN.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which mostly regulate gene expression by degrading the messages or inhibiting translation. Here we investigated changes in miRNA expression patterns after low (0.1 Gy) and high (2.0 Gy) doses of X-ray in human fibroblasts. At early (0.5 h) and late (6 and 24 h) time points irradiation caused qualitative and quantitative differences in the down-regulation of miRNA levels including miR-92b 137 660 and 656. A transient up-regulation of miRNAs was observed after 2 h post-irradiation following high doses of radiation including miR-558 and 662. MicroRNA levels were inversely correlated with targets from mRNA and proteomic profiling after 2.0 Gy of radiation. MicroRNAs miR-579 608 548-3p and 585 are noted for targeting genes involved in radioresponsive mechanisms such as cell cycle checkpoint and apoptosis. We suggest here a model in which miRNAs may act as hub regulators of specific cellular responses immediately down-regulated so as to stimulate DNA repair mechanisms followed by up-regulation involved in suppressing apoptosis for cell survival. Taken together miRNAs may mediate signaling pathways in sequential fashion in response to radiation and may serve as biodosimetric markers of radiation exposure. Overall design: The gene expression patterns in human fibroblasts after 2.0 Gy of low-LET radiation was determined at 2 and 24 hrs post-irradiation time in technical triplicates. Control non-irradiated samples were also prepared in triplicates.","title":"Gene expression profiling in human fibroblast after low-LET irradiation -

Perturbations in DDR pathway can originate from alteration in the functionality of the microRNA-mediated gene regulation being microRNAs (miRNAs) small noncoding RNA that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. In this study we gained insight into the role of miRNAs in the regulation of DDR to IR under microgravity a condition of weightlessness experienced by astronauts during space missions which could have a synergistic action on cells increasing the risk of radiation exposure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed miRNA expression profile of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) incubated for 4 and 24 h in normal gravity (1 g) and in modeled microgravity (MMG) during the repair time after irradiation with 0.2 and 2Gy of gamma-rays. Our results show that MMG alters miRNA expression signature of irradiated PBL by decreasing the number of radio-responsive miRNAs. Moreover let-7i* miR-7 miR-7-1* miR-27a miR-144 miR-200a miR-598 miR-650 are deregulated by the combined action of radiation and MMG. Integrated analyses of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles carried out on PBL of the same donors identified significant miRNA-mRNA anti-correlations of DDR pathway. Gene Ontology analysis reports that the biological category of Response to DNA damage is enriched when PBL are incubated in 1 g but not in MMG. Moreover some anti-correlated genes of p53-pathway show a different expression level between 1 g and MMG. Functional validation assays using luciferase reporter constructs confirmed miRNA-mRNA interactions derived from target prediction analyses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: On the whole by integrating the transcriptome and microRNome we provide evidence that modeled microgravity can affects the DNA-damage response to IR in human PBL. Overall Design: Gene expression signature was defined in PBL irradiated with gamma-rays (2.0 Gy) and incubated in modeled microgravity (mmg) and in parallel ground conditions (1g) for 24h. Five independent experiments were performed for each donor to address which mRNAs were regulated on IR stress. The level of each transcript was represented as Log2.","title":"Gene expression profiling of PBL in response to ionising radiation and modeled microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-129_gqph-hpvk","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-129","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Gene expression profiling of PBL in response to ionising radiation and modeled microgravity"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/nasa-patents","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2014-07-30","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-31","keyword":["patents"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"NASA Public Data","hasEmail":"mailto:no-reply@data.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.nasa.gov"},"identifier":"gquh-watm","description":"This dataset shows information pertaining to NASA held and pending patents.","title":"NASA Patents","programCode":["026:046"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/gquh-watm/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/gquh-watm/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/gquh-watm/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/gquh-watm/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/gquh-watm/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/gquh-watm/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/gquh-watm/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"theme":["Raw Data"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/bacillus-subtilis-strains-at-low-pressure-5-kpa-versus-101-kpa-growth-nasagenelabglds-81gs","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["hybridization protocol","strain","pressure","p-gse50653-9","array scanning protocol","growth protocol","p-gse50653-13","p-gse50653-12","p-gse50653-11","p-gse50653-10","nucleic acid extraction protocol","labelling protocol"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-81_gsfn-vr7d","description":"Comparing the transcriptional responses of Bacillus subtilis strains WN624 and WN1106 at 5 kPa and 101 kPa.

Integrated analyses of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles carried out on PBL of the same donors identified significant miRNA-mRNA anti-correlations of DDR pathway. Gene Ontology analysis reports that the biological category of Response to DNA damage is enriched when PBL are incubated in 1 g but not in MMG. Moreover some anti-correlated genes of p53-pathway show a different expression level between 1 g and MMG. Functional validation assays using luciferase reporter constructs confirmed miRNA-mRNA interactions derived from target prediction analyses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: On the whole by integrating the transcriptome and microRNome we provide evidence that modeled microgravity can affects the DNA-damage response to IR in human PBL.","title":"Identification of miRNAs involved in cell response to ionising radiation and modeled microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-128_gsmb-wx43","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-128","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Identification of miRNAs involved in cell response to ionising radiation and modeled microgravity"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/global-change-master-directory-gcmd","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["paleoclimate","wise","sun-earth interaction","spectrometry","agriculture","atmosphere","biology","biosphere","climate","cryosphere","earth science","engineering","geospatial","hydrosphere","land","oceans","operations","wwhgd"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Lola M.

The Sku5 gene (AT4G12420) codes for a multi-copper oxidase-like protein SKU5 protein that is involved in directed root tip growth. The Sku5 protein is glycosylated GPI-anchored and localizes to the plasma membrane and the cell wall. The Sku5 gene is expressed most strongly in expanding tissues. The development of WS and Sku5 plants on orbit differs from that on the ground as demonstrated by the comparison of the gene expression profiles between 4 days old to 8 days old plant in the two environments. However the development of Sku5 mutant plants also differs from WS at either age and in either environment suggesting the role of the genetic background in these developmental decisions. The 4 days old Sku5 roots in orbit engaged substantially more genes than the 4 days old WS roots in orbit but also more than the 4 days old Sku5 roots on the ground. Overall the 4 days old roots differentially expressed more genes in spaceflight relative to ground than the 8 days old roots of either genotype. Finally the 4 days old Sku5 roots in orbit differ in 862 genes from the 8 days Sku5 roots in orbit while on the ground there is merely half of the number of genes differentially expressed between the 4 days and 8 days developmental stages of the Sku5 roots. APEX03-2 (Advanced Plant Experiment 03-2) also identified as TAGES-Isa (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System xe2 x80 x94Intracellular Signaling Architecture) was launched on SpaceX mission CRS-5 on 10 January 2015. Dry sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10-cm2 solid media plates and remained dormant until removed from cold stowage and exposed to light at the initiation of the experiment on the ISS (International Space Station). The plates were grown in the Vegetable Production System (VPS/Veggie) hardware on the Columbus Module of the ISS with the overhead LED lighting of the VPS. At four or for the second experimental set at eight days seedlings were harvested by an astronaut into KFT (Kennedy Fixation Tube) containing RNAlater solutions. Upon return to Earth the harvested material was used to compare the transcriptomes of each genotype and each age using RNAseq technology. The patterns of gene expression was compared between treatments (spaceflight versus ground control) within each genotype of same age or between two ages within same genotype and within same treatment. For 4 day old roots 5-8 roots were combined to serve as one biological replica. For 8 day old roots 2-3 roots were used to form one biological replica. In each case the four biological replicas were used for the transcriptomic analysis.","title":"During development the Sku5 mutant roots engage different genes than wild type WS roots either on the ground or in spaceflight.","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-281","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"During development the Sku5 mutant roots engage different genes than wild type WS roots either on the ground or in spaceflight."}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gazetteer-of-planetary-nomenclature-nasa-000003854","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","temporal":"1977-01-01/2014-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["wise","space science","nen","geography"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Jennifer Blue","hasEmail":"mailto:jblue@usgs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000038__54","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

Thus identification and characterization of bystander mechanisms will help to development of new treatments of patients with a radiation exposure. In the present study we irradiated 3-dimensional tissue model of human epidermis Epi-200 (Mat-Tek Ashland MA) with 2.5 Gy protons. By exposing only a thin strip across the center of the EPI-200 tissue we have been able to measure global gene expression responses in directly irradiated and bystander cells located at 0.125-0.375 0.375-0.625 0.625-875 mm from the irradiation line. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH) and further gene ontology analysis and network analysis was performed with Panther (Applied Biosystems) and IPA (Ingenuity) accordingly. Significantly responding genes were identified at all distances and included sets common to both direct and bystander responses. False discovery rate in bystander samples did not exceed 20% (p=0.001) and was sufficiently low in the samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure (0.06-1.16%). Analysis of the fragments cut at the same distance revealed 52 54 and 88 differentially expressed genes. These gene lists overlapped each other had from 3 to 12 genes in common including CLED2 S100A7A. Samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure discovered 949 differentially expressed genes. Moreover the performed gene ontology analysis showed there overrepresentation of TP53 pathway (pathways p=2.04E-02) a common marker of direct irradiation response and also overrepresentation of the following groups of genes: signal transduction (p=4.52E-04) cell communication (p=1.24E-04) and cell cycle in the category of biological processes; DNA helicase activity (p=2.54E-07) receptor binding (p=6.19E-04) calcium ion binding proteins (p=2.57E-03) as the molecular functions. Differentially expresses genes of bystander samples had few categories in common such as cell communication (p=2.36E-03) and signal transduction (p=2.42E-03) among the biological processes and receptor activity (p=4.54E-03) among the molecular functions. Categories specific for the bystander samples included G-protein coupled receptors (p=7.24E-03) and ligand-gated ion channels (p=4.16E-03) suggesting a role of external stimulation and ion trafficking in bystander mechanisms. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model Epi-200 was measured in 16 hours after exposure to 2.5 Gy of protons. Four independent experiments were performed for the samples collected at different distances from the irradiation line (125-375 375-625 and 625-875 micrometers) using three tissue fragments per a data point.

As part of the PROTECT experiment spores of B. subtilis 168 were exposed to real space conditions and to simulated martian conditions for 559 days in low Earth orbit mounted on the EXPOSE-E exposure platform outside the European Columbus module on the International Space Station. Upon return spores were germinated total RNA extracted and fluorescently labeled and used to probe a custom Bacillus subtilis microarray to identify genes preferentially activated or repressed relative to ground control spores. Increased transcript levels were detected for a number of stress-related regulons responding to DNA damage (SOS response SP-beta prophage induction) protein damage (CtsR/Clp system) oxidative stress (PerR regulon) and cell envelope stress (SigV regulon). Spores exposed to space demonstrated a much broader and more severe stress response than spores exposed to simulated Mars conditions.

Presumably extraterrestrial infection may trigger potentially novel bionetworks different from the terrestrial equivalent which could only be probed by investigating the host-pathogen relationship with minimum terrestrial bias. Towards this objective we strategically engineered a cell culture module equipped with a feedback controlled semi-automated platform to expose human endothelial cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The assay was carried out in the STS-135 space shuttle and a concurrent ground study constituted the baseline. Transcriptomic investigation revealed an immune blunting in microgravity; Lbp MyD88 and MD-2 failed to encode proteins responsible for early LPS uptake. Longer exposure results implied that there was a delayed response potentially ineffectual in preventing pathogens from opportunistically modulating the infection network. Lack of recruitment of growth factors and a debilitated apoptosome supported this potential explanation. Certain cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 surged in response to LPS insult in microgravity. Contrasting expressions of B2M TIMP-1 and VEGRs suggested impaired pro-survival adaptation and healing mechanisms. The susceptibility of oxidative stress and immune regulation to microgravity compelled further investigation of the respective microRNA modulators such as miR-200a and miR-146b. These miRNAs were expressed differently in response to LPS assaults in different gravitational limits. In conclusion despite a serious drawback attributed to the small sample size we delineated some of the important aspects of the extraterrestrial etiology; more comprehensive follow up studies are warranted. Present study though compromised by the small sample size was able to shade lights on several aspects of immunological responses to the endotoxic assault mediated by uG. Implementing the host-pathogen interactions in the spaceflight and subsequently lysing the cells onboard presented the critical distinguishing features of the present study from the past reports. We identified the CCM of Tissue Genesis Inc. HI as the suitable hardware system to carry out the experiment in the spaceflight. CCM is an automated feedback controlled module that can concurrently support 24 bioreactors following protocols exclusively programmed for individual bioreactor. For this experiment we use samples EA41 EA 47 EA45 and EA155 that were exposed to LPS for 4 hours. Samples EA123 EA165 EA127 EA126 were exposed to LPS for 8Hrs. Samples EA33 EA 125 EA79 and EA 39 were controls in this experiment.","title":"Immune responses to the in vitro LPS assault engineered in the spaceflight multi-omics study - nasa_genelab_GLDS-54_h4h3-7xph","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-54","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Immune responses to the in vitro LPS assault engineered in the spaceflight multi-omics study"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/global-1-km-sea-surface-temperature-g1sst","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"2003-01-01/2009-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["troposphere","chemistry","oceans","tes","in-situ","numerical weather forecasting","earth science","tropospheric emission spectrometer","google earth","oceanography","sst"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Dr. Yi Chao","hasEmail":"mailto:Yi.Chao-1@nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000041","description":"JPL OurOcean Portal: A daily, global Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data set is produced at 1-km (also known as ultra-high resolution) by the JPL ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System) group.","title":"Global 1-km Sea Surface Temperature (G1SST)","programCode":["026:000"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"ftp://sealion.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/outgoing/aquarius","mediaType":"application/x-netcdf"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular"},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/fermi-gbm-grb-list-of-detections","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["lat","space science","gbm","solar flares","fermi","pulsars","photons","particle physics","gamma-ray bursts","light arcs","astrophysics"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Stephen Elrod","hasEmail":"mailto:stephen.e.elrod@nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000234","description":"This List is based on GCN Circulars issued by the GBM collaboration.","title":"Fermi-GBM GRB list of detections","programCode":["026:014"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.asdc.asi.it/grbgbm/","mediaType":"text/html"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Space Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/tropical-cloud-precip-hybrid-regime-pr6x1-set","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2022-07-04","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-31","keyword":["modis","cloud","cloud-precipitation hybrid regime","imerg","precipitation"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Daeho Jin","hasEmail":"mailto:Daeho.Jin@nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Daeho Jin (Code613 in NASA GSFC)"},"identifier":"h5pe-bcfp","description":"Cloud-Precipitation Hybrid Regimes with MODIS C6.1 2D joint histogram of CTP and COT (total 42 bins) and IMERG v06B precipitation histogram (total 6 bins) derived in 15S-15N domain.\nThis version is for precip weight=1, so cloud:precip = 7:1 ratio.

Even less is known about plants  response to partial or reduced gravity levels. In the absence of the directional cues provided by the gravity vector the plant is especially perceptive to other cues such as light. Here we investigate the response of Arabidopsis thaliana 6-day-old seedlings to microgravity and the Mars partial gravity level during spaceflight as well as the effects of red light photostimulation by determining meristematic cell growth and proliferation. These experiments involve microscopic techniques together with transcriptomic studies. We demonstrate that microgravity and partial gravity trigger differential responses. The microgravity environment activates hormonal routes responsible for proliferation/growth and upregulates plastid/mitochondrial-encoded transcripts even in the dark. In contrast the Mars gravity level inhibits these routes and activates responses to stress factors to restore cell growth parameters only when red photostimulation is provided. This response is accompanied by upregulation of numerous transcription factors such as the environmental acclimation-related WRKY family. In the long term these discoveries can be applied in the design of bioregenerative life support systems and space farming.","title":"Adaptive response of Arabidopsis seedlings in microgravity and Mars reduced gravity environment is enhanced by red light photostimulation","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-314","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Adaptive response of Arabidopsis seedlings in microgravity and Mars reduced gravity environment is enhanced by red light photostimulation"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/rodent-research-1-rr1-nasa-validation-flight-mouse-adrenal-gland-transcriptomic-proteomic-","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid extraction","library construction","proteomic labeling","sample collection","rna library construction","mass spectrometry","protein extraction","nucleic acid sequencing","animal and tissue sampling","dna library construction","labeling","microgravity"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-98_h8y7-i98w","description":"NASA  s Rodent Research (RR) project is playing a critical role in advancing biomedical research on the physiological effects of space environments.

Laboratory-controlled hypobaria however allows the dissection of pressure effects away from the effects typically associated with altitude in particular hypoxia as the partial pressure of O2 can be varied. In this study whole transcriptomes of plants grown in ambient (97 kPa/pO2 = 21 kPa) atmospheric conditions were compared to those of plants transferred to five different atmospheres of varying pressure and oxygen composition for 24 h: 50 kPa/pO2 = 10 kPa 25 kPa/pO2 = 5 kPa 50 kPa/pO2 = 21 kPa 25 kPa/pO2 = 21 kPa or 97 kPa/pO2 = 5 kPa. The plants exposed to these environments were 10 day old Arabidopsis seedlings grown vertically on hydrated nutrient plates. In addition 5 day old plants were also exposed for 24 h to the 50 kPa and ambient environments to evaluate age-dependent responses. The gene expression profiles from roots and shoots showed that the hypobaric response contained more complex gene regulation than simple hypoxia and that adding back oxygen to normoxic conditions did not completely alleviate gene expression changes in hypobaric responses.","title":"Dissecting Low Atmospheric Pressure Stress: Transcriptome Responses to the Components of Hypobaria in Arabidopsis [Experiment 2] - nasa_genelab_GLDS-136_hqvu-bwfr","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-136","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Dissecting Low Atmospheric Pressure Stress: Transcriptome Responses to the Components of Hypobaria in Arabidopsis [Experiment 2]"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/calipso-lidar-l2-aerosol-layer-data-v3-01","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"2006-06-13/2011-10-31","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["atmospheric science","cloud","climate","radiation","aerosol","satellite","eos"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"John M.

The Rapid Freeze hardware freezes mouse tissues (Glovebox freezer) and whole carcasses (Cryochiller) at rates closely mimicking those attained with immersion in liquid nitrogen. Because this hardware will be used extensively on future rodent research missions it is crucial to understand whether or not it preserves signals in gene expression data in order to maximize the value of these rare and expensive spaceflight experiments.

Little is known about the contribution of genome level changes in neighboring bystander cells to tissue and organ stress after irradiation. The timing of these changes is critical in the physiological context and these questions can only be answered by studying signaling and global transcriptomics in a chronological way. Here we present a strategy to identify different biologically important signaling modules that act in concert in the radiation and bystander responses. We used time series gene expression analysis of normal human fibroblast cells measured at 0.5 hour 1 hour 2 hours 4 hours 6 hours and 24 hours after exposure to radiation coupled with a novel clustering method targeted to short time series Feature Based Partitioning around medoids Algorithm (FBPA) to look for genes that were potentially co-regulated. This method uses biologically meaningful features of the expression profile and dimension augmentation to address the analysis of sparse data sets such as ours. We applied FBPA and Short Time series Expression Miner (STEM) to the same datasets and present the results of our comparisons using computational metrics as well as biological enrichment. Enrichment showed that gene expression in irradiated cells fell into broad categories of signal transduction cell cycle/cell death and inflammation/immunity; but only FBPA clustered functions well. In bystander cells the gene expression response was also broadly categorized into functions associated with cell communication and motility signal transduction and inflammation; but neither STEM nor FBPA separated biological functions as well as in irradiated samples. Network analysis revealed that p53 and NF-kappaB were central players in gene expression in both irradiated and bystander gene clusters. Analysis of individual clusters also suggested new regulators of gene expression in the radiation and bystander response that may act at the epigenetic level such as histone deacetylases (HDAC1 and HDAC2) and methylases (KDM5B) that can act as strong transcription repressors. Based on these results we propose a novel time series clustering method FBPA as a powerful approach that can be applied to sparse data sets (including genomic profiling data) where the choice of features selected for clustering and stringent statistical outcome analysis can augment our knowledge of the underlying cellular mechanisms in biological processes.

We examined the effect of nine days of bed rest on basal and insulin stimulated expression of genes potentially involved in insulin action by applying hypothesis-generating microarray in parallel with candidate gene real-time PCR approaches in 20 healthy, young men. Furthermore, we investigated whether bed rest affected DNA methylation in the promoter region of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A) gene. Subjects were re-examined after four weeks of retraining. Findings: Bed rest induced insulin resistance and altered the expression of more than 4,500 genes. These changes were only partly normalized after four weeks of retraining. Pathway analyses revealed significant down-regulation of 34 pathways, predominantly those of genes associated with mitochondrial function including PPARGC1A. Despite induction of insulin resistance, bed rest resulted in a paradoxically increased response to acute insulin in the general expression of genes, particularly those involved in inflammation and endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress. Furthermore, bed rest changed gene expressions of several insulin resistance and diabetes candidate genes. We also observed a trend toward increased PPARGC1A DNA methylation after bed rest. Conclusions: Impaired expression of PPARGC1A and other genes involved in mitochondrial function as well as a paradoxically increased response to insulin of genes involved in inflammation and ER stress may contribute to the development of insulin resistance induced by bed rest. Lack of complete normalization of changes after four weeks of exercise retraining underscores the importance of maintaining a minimum of daily physical activity.']","title":"['Insulin resistance induced by physical inactivity is associated with multiple transcriptional changes in skeletal muscle in young men']","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-370","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"['Insulin resistance induced by physical inactivity is associated with multiple transcriptional changes in skeletal muscle in young men']"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/medaka-osteoclast-nasagenelabglds-133hy47-cerq","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid extraction","library construction","microgravity","sample collection","nucleic acid sequencing","timepoint"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-133_hy47-cerq","description":"During space flight bone mineral density is decreased by the influence of osteoclast activation which molecular mechanism is expectantly investigated.

It raises concerns for the interpretation of risks from exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation. Sparse data exists about the bystander signaling mechanisms and the ability to transmit damaging effects both spatially and temporally. To understand early signaling and cellular changes in bystanders we have measured global gene expression 30 minutes after direct and bystander exposure to alpha particle in primary human lung fibroblasts. Gene ontology and pathway analyses suggested that the earliest measured changes at 30 minutes after treatment are in cell structure motility and adhesion categories and a significant number of genes belong to the category of inflammation and cell-to-cell communication. We investigated time course gene expression profiles of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3 (MMP1 and MMP3) chemokine ligands 2 3 and 5 (CXCL2 CXCL3 and CXCL5) interleukins 1a 1b 6 and 33 (IL1A IL1B IL6 and IL33) growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and superoxide dismutase2 (SOD2) by real time quantitative PCR. These encode proteins involved in cellular signaling via the NFkappaB pathway and time course of mRNA levels revealed an increased response at 30 minutes after irradiation followed by another wave at 4 to 6 hours. We also investigated protein modifications in the AKT-GSK-3 signaling pathway and found that in irradiated cells AKT and GSK3beta are hyper-phosphorylated at 30 minutes and this effect is maintained until 4 hours after exposure. In bystanders there is a similar response with a delay of 30 minutes. In irradiated cells inactivated GSK3beta led to decreased phosphorylation of beta-catenin. Our results are the first to show that the radiation induced bystander signal can induce a widespread gene expression response as early as 30 minutes after exposure and that these changes are accompanied by protein modification of signaling modules such as AKT and GSK3beta.

Various DNA damaging agents induce different spectra of DNA damage as well as collateral damage to other cellular components and therefore are not expected to provoke identical responses by the cell. Here we study the effects of two different types of ionizing radiation (IR) treatment HZE (1 GeV Fe26+ high mass high charge and high energy relativistic particles) and gamma photons on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Both types of IR induce small clusters of radicals that can result in the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs) but HZE also produces linear arrays of extremely clustered damage. We performed these experiments across a range of time points (1.5-24 h after irradiation) in both wild-type plants and in mutants defective in the DSB-sensing protein kinase ATM. The two types of IR exhibit a shared double strand break-repair-related damage response although they differ slightly in the timing degree and ATM-dependence of the response. The ATM-dependent DNA metabolism-related transcripts of the DSB response were also induced by other DNA damaging agents but were not induced by conventional stresses. Both Gamma and HZE irradiation induced at 24 h post-irradiation ATM-dependent transcripts associated with a variety of conventional stresses; these were overrepresented for pathogen response rather than DNA metabolism. In contrast only HZE-irradiated plants at 1.5 h after irradiation exhibited an additional and very extensive transcriptional response shared with plants experiencing extended night. This response was not apparent in gamma-irradiated plants. We treated 5-day-old WT and atm-1 seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana with 100 Gy of Gamma radiation (over a span of 15 minutes) or 30 Gy of HZE (over a span of approximately 12 minutes). Gamma irradiations were completed at 8:40 am while HZE irradiations were conducted in two runs (due to space limitations) which were completed at 1:09 and 1:28pm respectively. Gamma treated seedlings were sampled at 10:10 am 11:40 am 2:55 pm 8:40 pm and 8:40 am. HZE treated seedlings were sampled at 2:39 pm 4:09 pm 7:24 pm 1:09 am and 1:09 pm. Un-irradiated WT and atm-1 control seedlings were sampled at 10:45 am on Day #1 and 9:15 am on Day #2.

After 3 months brain was sampled from one mouse in group GC and LC respectively. Comprehensive analyses of gene expression were performed in the right brain. Total of 4,000 genes were analyzed. The expression levels of 60 genes significantly changed in response to SF compared with LC and/or GC. The 15 and 16 genes were up- (> 2 folds) and down-regulated (< 0.5 folds) respectively following SF vs. GC. The levels of 58 genes were significantly altered by housing in MDS in space and/or on the ground. Forty seven and 11 genes were significantly up- and down-regulated vs. LC. Twenty seven out of these genes responded to caging in MDS both in space and on the ground. Further 31 genes were influenced by housing in MDS on the Earth.

We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to more normal bipolar budding patterns for ground samples in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally downregulation of genes involved in the actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested as this regulator is involved in random budding cell aggregation actin cytoskeleton and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. albicans. While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed. This study represents an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during spaceflight missions. Furthermore since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms with downstream benefits for the general public. Cells were grown for 24 hours on the space shuttle or as ground-based controls preserved in RNALater and stored at -80C. Four samples of each flight- and ground-based controls were harvested for microarray analysis. GAP is Group Activation Pack and each GAP contains 8 FPAs. The numbers represent the # assigned to the particular GAP and the number assigned to the specific FPA (1-8) within the indicated GAP. The same hardware is used for the flight samples and the ground samples.","title":"Candida albicans response to spaceflight (NASA STS-115) - nasa_genelab_GLDS-20_ijep-7gnq","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-20","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Candida albicans response to spaceflight (NASA STS-115)"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gazetteer-of-planetary-nomenclature-nasa-000003831","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1977-01-01/2014-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["wise","nen","geography","space science"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Jennifer Blue","hasEmail":"mailto:jblue@usgs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000038__31","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

However simulation experiments on ground without space constraints show weaker effects than space environment. A global and integrative analysis using the gene expression dynamics inspector (GEDI) self-organizing maps reveals a subtle response of the transcriptome using different populations and microgravity and hypergravity simulation devices. These results suggest that in addition to behavioural responses that can be detected also at the gene expression level the transcriptome is finely tuned to normal gravity. The alteration of this constant parameter on Earth can have effects on gene expression that depends both on the environmental conditions and the ground based facility used to compensate the gravity vector. Alternative and commons effects of mechanical facilities like the Random Positioning Machine and a centrifuge and strong magnetic field ones like a cryogenically cooled superconductive magnet are discussed.

Unsupervised clustering analysis of gene expression segregated samples according to the radiation (IR) response and time after exposure with 56Fe-IR showing the greatest level of gene modulation. 1H-IR exposures showed little differential transcript modulation. Network analysis categorized the major differentially expressed genes into cell cycle oxidative responses and transcriptional regulation functional groups. Transcriptional networks identified key nodes regulating expression. Individual transcription factors were inferred to be active at 1 3 7 14 and 28 days after exposure. Validation of the signal transduction network by protein analysis showed that particle IR clearly regulates a long lived signaling mechanism for p38 MAPK signaling and NFATc4 activation. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays supported the role of additional key transcription factors GATA-4 STAT-3 and NF-kB as regulators of the response at specific time points. These data suggest that the molecular response to 56Fe-IR is unique and shows long-lasting gene expression in cardiomyocytes up to 28 days after exposure.

Whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray and high throughput proteomics which offer the possibility to survey respectively the global transcriptional and translational response of an organism were used to test the effect of space flight. Moreover in an effort to identify a specific stress response of R. rubrum to space flight ground simulation of space ionizing radiation and space gravity were performed under identical culture setup and growth conditions encountered during the actual space journey. This study is unique in combining the results from an actual space experiment with the corresponding space ionizing radiation and modeled microgravity ground simulations which lead to a more solid dissection of the different factors contribution acting in space flight conditions. Total RNA was extracted from R. rubrum S1H grown after 10 days in space flight or after 10 days in simulated ionizing radiation or simulated microgravity.

Genes that are important in setting up the spaceflight responses are being identified; their role in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are required for survival has yet to be posed and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses of two Arabidopsis ecotypes Col-0 and WS as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS phyD displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0 suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed and even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the transcriptome cost of plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight and suggesting that genetic manipulation might further reduce or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0 suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation which further implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. CARA Seed Lines and Planting: Three seed lines Wild-Type Wassilewskija (Ws) Columbia-0 (Col-0) and Col-0 PhyD (phyD) Mutants were tested for viability sterility and ability to maintain dormancy before the launch. Tested batches of seeds were planted on phytagel plates as one genotype per plate for gene expression analysis in replicates of three. One set was planted for the flight and one for ground control. The plates were wrapped such that every surface of the plate was covered by two layers of Duvetyn Black-Out cloth (Seattle Fabrics) (Sng et al 2014). The plates were stored 4 xb0 C until launch and was then launched in a cold-stow bag to maintain the plates at 4 xb0 C until integration and activation on the ISS. On Orbit Operations and harvest: The dormant plates were activated on station by removing the Black-Out cloth wrapping 12 days after launch. The plates were then placed on a fabric that was mounted in the US Laboratory module on the wall adjoining the MELFI freezer and secured using Velcro. The plants were allowed to grow on orbit for 11 days; some in the ambient light of ISS and some in the dark. The dark-grown plates were first activated by exposing the seeds to light for 4 hours and then re-wrapped in Black-Out cloth for the duration of the growth period. A corresponding set of seedlings were grown as ground control in KSC. At 11 days seedlings were photographed harvested into KFT containing RNAlater solutions and returned for post-flight analysis. All plates were harvested into KFTs with their counterpart (e.g. Light 1 was harvested with Dark 1). Once the plants were placed in the KFTs the KFT was actuated with RNAlater to preserve the sample. At 24 hours post-harvest KFTs were then transferred to MELFI the -32 xb0C freezer.

Our results show that 42 miRNAs were differentially expressed in MMG-incubated PBLs compared with 1g-incubated ones. Among these miR-9-5p miR-9-3p miR-155-5p miR-150-3p and miR-378-3p were the most dysregulated. To improve the detection of functional miRNA-mRNA pairs we performed gene expression profiles on the same samples assayed for miRNA profiling and we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression data. The functional classification of miRNA-correlated genes evidenced significant enrichments in the biological processes of immune/inflammatory response signal transduction regulation of response to stress regulation of programmed cell death and regulation of cell proliferation. We identified the correlation between miR-9-3p miR-155-5p miR-150-3p and miR-378-3p expression with that of genes involved in immune/inflammatory response (eg. IFNG and IL17F) apoptosis (eg. PDCD4 and PTEN) and cell proliferation (eg. NKX3-1 and GADD45A). Experimental assays of cell viability and apoptosis induction validated the results obtained by bioinformatics analyses demonstrating that in human PBLs the exposure to reduced gravitational force increases the frequency of apoptosis and decreases cell proliferation. microRNA expression profiling were carried out on total RNA extracted from PBLs of twelve healthy donors at the end of 24h-incubation time in MMG and in 1g conditions. Analyses were performed by using the Human miRNA Microarray kit (V2) (Agilent Technologies) that allows the detection of 723 known human (miRBase v.10.1) and 76 human viral miRNAs. By comparing the expression profile of MMG-incubated vs. 1g-incubated PBLs of the same donor we found 42 differentially expressed miRNAs 25 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated.","title":"microRNA expression profiles in human peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured in modeled microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-55_jjns-d4p9","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-55","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"microRNA expression profiles in human peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured in modeled microgravity"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gateway-to-astronaut-photography-of-earth-nasa-00000376","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1977-01-01/1996-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["space science","nen","wise","geography"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"William Stefanov","hasEmail":"mailto:jsc-earthweb@nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000037__6","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

Our results show that 42 miRNAs were differentially expressed in MMG-incubated PBLs compared with 1g-incubated ones. Among these miR-9-5p miR-9-3p miR-155-5p miR-150-3p and miR-378-3p were the most dysregulated. To improve the detection of functional miRNA-mRNA pairs we performed gene expression profiles on the same samples assayed for miRNA profiling and we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression data. The functional classification of miRNA-correlated genes evidenced significant enrichments in the biological processes of immune/inflammatory response signal transduction regulation of response to stress regulation of programmed cell death and regulation of cell proliferation. We identified the correlation between miR-9-3p miR-155-5p miR-150-3p and miR-378-3p expression with that of genes involved in immune/inflammatory response (eg. IFNG and IL17F) apoptosis (eg. PDCD4 and PTEN) and cell proliferation (eg. NKX3-1 and GADD45A). Experimental assays of cell viability and apoptosis induction validated the results obtained by bioinformatics analyses demonstrating that in human PBLs the exposure to reduced gravitational force increases the frequency of apoptosis and decreases cell proliferation. Gene expression profiling was carried out in MMG-incubated PBLs vs. 1g-incubated PBLs on total RNA extracted from the same PBL samples assayed for miRNA profiling. We used the Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray (Agilent) consisting of ~41.000 (60-mer) oligonucleotide probes which span conserved exons across the transcripts of the targeted full-length genes.","title":"Gene expression profiling of human peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured in modeled microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-56_k2nk-ifih","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-56","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Gene expression profiling of human peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured in modeled microgravity"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/rna-seq-analysis-of-mycobacteria-stress-response-to-microgravity-nasagenelabglds-90k45c-w3","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid extraction","nucleic acid sequencing","sample collection","simulated microgravity","library construction","timepoint"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-90_k45c-w3zt","description":"The aim of this work is to determine whether mycobacteria have enhanced virulence during space travel and what mechanisms they use to adapt to microgravity.

Using bioinformatics the amount of expression of the different M. marinum genes were compared between the NG and MG samples. To make sure that we were examining only gene expression changes due to MG only bacteria in early exponential growth were used in the RNAseq studies. Triplicate NG and MG cultures were used to generate samples of bacteria grown for ~40 hrs. We also grew triplicate cultures for 4 days and then diluted them again and grew them for another ~40 hrs so we could examine gene expression from bacteria exposed for a longer time.

RbohD and RbohF genes were up-regulated preferentially in NADPH oxidase genes which produce ROS.Conclusions: Our large-scale transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the space environment induced oxidative stress and ROS gene network was activated in the space-grown Mizuna some of which were common genes up-regulated by abiotic and biotic stress and were preferentially up-regulated genes by the space environment even though Mizuna grew in the space as well as on the ground showing that plants could acclimate to the space environment by reprograming the expression of ROS gene network.","title":"RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis of reactive oxygen species gene network in Mizuna plants grown in long-term space flight - nasa_genelab_GLDS-59_keei-s44n","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-59","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis of reactive oxygen species gene network in Mizuna plants grown in long-term space flight"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/rodent-research-1-rr1-nasa-validation-flight-mouse-soleus-muscle-transcriptomic-and-epigen","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-09-05","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid sequencing","nucleic acid extraction","spaceflight","rna sequencing library construction","mouse habitation","library construction","sample collection","dna sequencing library construction","animal husbandry","animal and tissue sampling"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-104_kegv-mjmr","description":"NASA  s Rodent Research (RR) project is playing a critical role in advancing biomedical research on the physiological effects of space environments.

The mechanism of radiation response includes inter-cellular signaling and intra-cellular communication by which the bystander signal is propagated. Methods: We measured the bystander response to 1Gy a-particle radiation in Mrad9-/- mouse stem cells and H1299shRAD9 cells using chromosomal aberration and micronucleus formation as DNA damage endpoints. In the H1299 model we used whole genome microarray analyses to profile the transcriptome of irradiated and bystander cells. Results: We investigated the role of RAD9 in the bystander response and showed that depletion or mutation of RAD9 had an effect of increasing chromosomal structural damage as well as micronucleus formation in bystander cells. The enhancement of the damage effect correlated strongly with a transcriptomic response in critical pathways. RAD9 depletion affected many pathways in the cell including the UV-MAPK pathway involving p38MAPK members STAT1 and PARP1 at the mRNA levels. There was an overall reduction of RNA biogenesis of gene members of this pathway suggesting that perhaps these signaling pathways do not function optimally after RAD9 depletion. Using network analysis we found there may be differential activation of transcriptional regulators between the irradiated and bystander cells involving the SP1 and NUPR1 transcription factors. Network analysis also suggested that HIF1a (Hypoxia induced factor 1a) activation could be a negative predictor of the bystander effect and perhaps that local hypoxic stress observed by cells that are directly exposed to radiation may predict whether or not they will elicit a bystander response. Gene expression in H1299 cells was measured at 4 hours after exposure to 1 Gy a-particles. There were two groups based on RAD9 status RAD9 normal and RAD9 depleted by siRNA. In each of these groups sham irradiated direct irradiated cells for positive bystanders positive bystanders direct irradiated cells for negative bystanders and negative bystanders; were identified based on micronucleus responses. Five biological replicates were analyzed for each experimental group.","title":"Radiation-induced bystander effects and gene expression in cells deficient for RAD9","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-183","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Radiation-induced bystander effects and gene expression in cells deficient for RAD9"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/api-documents/foundry/#/data.nasa.gov/gvk9-iz74","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2015-11-30","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","references":["https://data.nasa.gov/developer"],"keyword":["center management operations","center","api","contact","location","status","building"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Jason Duley","hasEmail":"mailto:jason.duley@nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"API-18","description":"API of NASA facilities.","title":"NASA Facilities API","programCode":["026:045"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://data.nasa.gov/resource/gvk9-iz74.json","description":"API of NASA facilities.","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"NASA Facilities API"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Management/Operations"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/fermigbrst-fermi-gbm-burst-catalog","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["gbm","space science","lat","astrophysics","fermi","solar flares","photons","pulsars","gamma-ray bursts","light arcs","particle physics"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Phil Newman","hasEmail":"mailto:panewman@lheapop.gsfc.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000230","description":"This table lists all of the triggers observed by a subset of the 14 GBM detectors (12 NaI and 2 BGO) which have been classified as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).

Perturbations in DDR pathway can originate from alteration in the functionality of the microRNA-mediated gene regulation being microRNAs (miRNAs) small noncoding RNA that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. In this study we gained insight into the role of miRNAs in the regulation of DDR to IR under microgravity a condition of weightlessness experienced by astronauts during space missions which could have a synergistic action on cells increasing the risk of radiation exposure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed miRNA expression profile of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) incubated for 4 and 24 h in normal gravity (1 g) and in modeled microgravity (MMG) during the repair time after irradiation with 0.2 and 2Gy of gamma-rays. Our results show that MMG alters miRNA expression signature of irradiated PBL by decreasing the number of radio-responsive miRNAs. Moreover let-7i* miR-7 miR-7-1* miR-27a miR-144 miR-200a miR-598 miR-650 are deregulated by the combined action of radiation and MMG. Integrated analyses of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles carried out on PBL of the same donors identified significant miRNA-mRNA anti-correlations of DDR pathway. Gene Ontology analysis reports that the biological category of Response to DNA damage is enriched when PBL are incubated in 1 g but not in MMG. Moreover some anti-correlated genes of p53-pathway show a different expression level between 1 g and MMG. Functional validation assays using luciferase reporter constructs confirmed miRNA-mRNA interactions derived from target prediction analyses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: On the whole by integrating the transcriptome and microRNome we provide evidence that modeled microgravity can affects the DNA-damage response to IR in human PBL.","title":"Identification of miRNAs involved in cell response to ionising radiation and modeled microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-128_krvn-94zk","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-128","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Identification of miRNAs involved in cell response to ionising radiation and modeled microgravity"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gazetteer-of-planetary-nomenclature-nasa-000003879","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1977-01-01/2014-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["space science","nen","wise","geography"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Jennifer Blue","hasEmail":"mailto:jblue@usgs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000038__79","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stresses, we examined the relevance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. To do so, we compared the transcriptional responses of wild type and UPR-defective seedlings to spaceflight during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space Station. We established that orbital culture substantially altered the expression of hundreds of stress related genes compared to ground control conditions. Although many of these genes were differentially regulated in the UPR mutants in the ground control conditions compared to wild type, their expression was largely equalized in all genotypes by flight. Our results have yielded new information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks.']","title":"['Relevance of Unfolded Protein Response to Spaceflight-Induced Transcriptional Reprogramming in Arabidopsis']","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-321","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"['Relevance of Unfolded Protein Response to Spaceflight-Induced Transcriptional Reprogramming in Arabidopsis']"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/response-of-human-lymphoblastoid-cells-to-hze-iron-ions-or-gamma-rays-nasagenelabglds-2kxw","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-09-05","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["p-gse16518-3","p-gse16518-4","p-gse16518-5","p-gse16518-6","p-gse16518-7","nucleic_acid_extraction","irradiation","image_aquisition","hybridization","grow","feature_extraction","labeling","bioassay_data_transformation","specified_biomaterial_action","p-gse16518-8","p-gse16518-1","p-gse16518-2"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-2_kxwk-sfex","description":"Transcriptional profiling of human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells comparing mock irradiated cells with cells exposed 24 hours previously to 1.67 Gy HZE (1 GeV/amu iron ions accelerated at the NASA Space Research Laboratory (NSRL) of Brookhaven National Laboratory) or 2.5 Gy 137Cs gamma rays.

Putative secondary metabolite analysis indicates that ISS-F3/F4 may produce yet-unreported polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. While genomic analysis showed that these ISS strains are unlikely to be plant pathogens, a virulence assay using an immunocompromised Caenorhabditis elegans model of fusariosis revealed that they were virulent and may represent opportunistic pathogens in animals, including humans.

The following table provides a chronological data summary of fireball and bolide events provided by U.S. Government sensors. Ground-based observers sometimes also witness these events at night, or much more rarely in daylight, as impressive atmospheric light displays. This website is not meant to be a complete list of all fireball events. Only the brightest fireballs are noted.\r\n\r\nA meteoroid is generally defined as an asteroid or comet fragment that orbits the Sun and has an approximate size between ten microns and a meter or so. Meteors, or \"shooting stars,\" are the visible paths of meteoroids that have entered the Earth's atmosphere at high velocities. A fireball is an unusually bright meteor that reaches a visual magnitude of -3 or brighter when seen at the observer's zenith. Objects causing fireball events can exceed one meter in size. Fireballs that explode in the atmosphere are technically referred to as bolides although the terms fireballs and bolides are often used interchangeably.\r\n\r\nDuring the atmospheric entry phase, an impacting object is both slowed and heated by atmospheric friction. In front of it, a bow shock develops where atmospheric gases are compressed and heated. Some of this energy is radiated to the object causing it to ablate, and in most cases, to break apart. Fragmentation increases the amount of atmosphere intercepted and so enhances ablation and atmospheric braking. The object catastrophically disrupts when the force from the unequal pressures on the front and back sides exceeds its tensile strength.\r\n\r\nObjects causing fireballs are usually not large enough to survive passage through the Earth's atmosphere intact, although fragments, or meteorites, are sometimes recovered on the ground. The approximate total radiated energy in the atmosphere is provided in unit of Joules, a unit of energy given in kilograms times velocity squared, or kg x (m/s)2. An event with an energy equivalent of one thousand tons of TNT explosives is termed a kiloton (kt) event, where 1 kt = 4.185 x 1012 Joules. In the accompanying table, the total radiated energy is given but this is always less that the total impact energy. Peter Brown and colleagues have provided an empirical expression to approximately provide the total impact energy in kt (E), given the optical radiant energy in kt (Eo) (see: Brown et al., The flux of small near-Earth objects colliding with the Earth. Nature, vol. 420, 21 Nov. 2002, pp. 294-296).\r\n\r\nE = 8.2508 x Eo0.885\r\n\r\nThe accompanying table provides information on the date and time of each fireball event, its geographic location, its altitude and velocity at peak brightness, its approximate total optical radiated energy and its calculated total impact energy. The pre-impact velocity components are expressed in a geocentric Earth-fixed reference frame defined as follows: the z-axis is directed along the Earth's rotation axis towards the celestial north pole, the x-axis lies in the Earth's equatorial plane, directed towards the prime meridian, and the y-axis completes the right-handed coordinate system.\r\n\r\nhttp://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/fireball/","title":"Fireball And Bolide Reports","programCode":["026:009"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/mc52-syum/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/mc52-syum/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/mc52-syum/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/mc52-syum/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/mc52-syum/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/mc52-syum/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/mc52-syum/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"theme":["Space Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/iss-surfaces-bacterial-genomes-from-mt-2-iss-mop","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid sequencing","spaceflight","library construction","sequence assembly","strain","sample collection","nucleic acid extraction"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-361_mcni-iiwd","description":"Draft genomes of various bacterial phyla isolated from different locations on the International Space Station, as part of the Microbial Tracking 2 mission (ISS-MOP).","title":"ISS Surfaces Bacterial Genomes from MT-2 (ISS-MOP)","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-361","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ISS Surfaces Bacterial Genomes from MT-2 (ISS-MOP)"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/tropical-cpr-identification-data-for-organization-metric","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2022-02-17","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-31","keyword":["precipitation","organization metrics","clouds","cloud-precipitation hybrid regime","tropical meteorology"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Daeho Jin","hasEmail":"mailto:daeho.jin@nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Daeho Jin"},"identifier":"md8t-ur38","description":"There are three kinds of files are in one zip file. \n1) Cloud-Precipitation (hybrid) regime information projected onto hourly IMERG precipitation data (Version Pr6x7 in 15S-15N, 2000.06.01-2021.06.29 (7699 days), 24 steps per day, -24.5 to 24.5N (nlat=50), and -179.5 to 179.5 (nlon=360);

Osteoclast is the multinucleated bone resorbing cell. In this study we used NASA developed ground based Rotary Wall Vessel Bioreactor (RWV) Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) to simulate microgravity (uXg) conditions and demonstrated a significant increase (2-fold) in osteoclastogenesis compared to ground based control (Xg) mouse bone marrow cultures. We further determined the gene expression profiling of RAW 264.7 osteoclast progenitor cells in microgravity by agilent microarray analysis. Gene expression pattern was functional group clustered by transcriptome analysis using gene ontology tree machine (GOTM) for cell proliferation/survival differentiation and function. We confirm the microgravity modulated gene expression critical for osteoclast differentiation by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in murine bone marrow cultures. We identify transcription factors such as c-Jun c-Fos PU-1 critical for osteoclast differentiation is up-regulated in microgravity conditions. In addition microgravity resulted in 2.3 and 2.0-fold increase in the level of cathepsin K and MMP-9 matrix metalloproteinase expression in preosteoclast cells involved in the bone resorption process respectively. We also demonstrate a significant increase in the expression levels of M-CSF receptor c-Fms and PLCy2 and S100A8 molecules that play an important role in Ca2+ signaling essential for osteoclast function. Further microgravity stimulated preosteoclast cells showed elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels compared to ground based control cells. Thus microgravity regulated gene expression profiling in preosteoclast cells provide new insights in to molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of osteoclast differentiation/activation responsible for bone loss and fracture risk in astronauts during space flight mission. Microgravity associated with space flight is a challenge for normal bone homeostasis. Astronauts experience 10-15% bone loss during a space flight mission. We aimed to determine the effect of simulated microgravity on osteoclast preosteoclasts cells. RAW264.7 cells (1.5 x 106 /ml) were loaded in RCCS with DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were stimulated with RANKL (80ng/ml) for 24 h to obtain preosteoclasts in parallel with ground based control cells. Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol reagent (Biotecx Labs Houston TX) from control (Xg) and microgravity (uXg) subjected cells and hybridized with Agilent whole mouse genome 4x44K array system. Slides were washed and scanned on an Agilent G2565 microarray scanner. Data obtained were analyzed with Agilent feature extraction and GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 software packages (Genus biosystem Inc.

Arabidopsis seedlings and undifferentiated cultured Arabidopsis cells were launched in April 2010 as part of the BRIC-16 flight experiment on STS-131. Biologically replicated DNA microarray and averaged RNA digital transcript profiling revealed several hundred genes in seedlings and cell cultures that were significantly affected by launch and spaceflight. The response was moderate in seedlings; only a few genes were induced by more than 7-fold and the overall intrinsic expression level for most differentially expressed genes was low. In contrast cell cultures displayed a more dramatic response with dozens of genes showing this level of differential expression a list comprised primarily of heat shock-related and stress-related genes. This baseline transcriptome profiling of seedlings and cultured cells confirms the fundamental hypothesis that survival of the spaceflight environment requires adaptive changes that are both governed and displayed by alterations in gene expression. The comparison of intact plants with cultures of undifferentiated cells confirms a second hypothesis: undifferentiated cells can detect spaceflight in the absence of specialized tissue or organized developmental structures known to detect gravity.","title":"Transcription profiling by array of the response of Arabidopsis cultivar Columbia etiolated seedlings and undifferentiated tissue culture cells to the spaceflight environment - nasa_genelab_GLDS-17_mv3i-w3jk","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-17","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Transcription profiling by array of the response of Arabidopsis cultivar Columbia etiolated seedlings and undifferentiated tissue culture cells to the spaceflight environment"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gateway-to-astronaut-photography-of-earth-nasa-00000374","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1977-01-01/1996-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["geography","wise","space science","nen"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"William Stefanov","hasEmail":"mailto:jsc-earthweb@nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000037__4","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

Once returned RNA was isolated and RNAseq performed to catalog the transcriptional patterns of the plants grown in space. An identical set of samples were grown in parallel on the ground to provide controls to allow assessment of transcriptional changes specifically associated with the spaceflight environment. This data release includes 48 out of 56 sample expression files with the remaining 8 files to be released at a later date.","title":"Comparison of the spaceflight transcriptome of four commonly used Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes - nasa_genelab_GLDS-37_n47v-4ngw","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-37","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Comparison of the spaceflight transcriptome of four commonly used Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/draft-genome-sequences-of-rhodotorula-mucilaginosa-isolated-from-the-international-space-s","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid extraction","library construction","nucleic acid sequencing","strain","spaceflight","sample collection","sequence assembly"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-293_n4rm-hn8p","description":"Draft Genome sequences of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa isolated from the International space station.","title":"Draft Genome sequences of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa isolated from the International space station","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-293","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Draft Genome sequences of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa isolated from the International space station"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/worms-spun-in-centrifuge-at-elevated-g-values-nasagenelabglds-190n5gq-2sq5","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["p-gse38877-6","sample treatment protocol","p-gse38877-5","p-gse38877-4","p-gse38877-3","p-gse38877-2","p-gse38877-1","nucleic acid extraction protocol","normalization data transformation protocol","labelling protocol","hybridization protocol","gravity altered","array scanning protocol"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-190_n5gq-2sq5","description":"Worms spun at higher than normal g values for 4 days on 20G centrifuge vs. worms kept at 1 X G.

Unsupervised clustering analysis of gene expression segregated samples according to the radiation (IR) response and time after exposure with 56Fe-IR showing the greatest level of gene modulation. 1H-IR exposures showed little differential transcript modulation. Network analysis categorized the major differentially expressed genes into cell cycle oxidative responses and transcriptional regulation functional groups. Transcriptional networks identified key nodes regulating expression. Individual transcription factors were inferred to be active at 1 3 7 14 and 28 days after exposure. Validation of the signal transduction network by protein analysis showed that particle IR clearly regulates a long lived signaling mechanism for p38 MAPK signaling and NFATc4 activation. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays supported the role of additional key transcription factors GATA-4 STAT-3 and NF-kB as regulators of the response at specific time points. These data suggest that the molecular response to 56Fe-IR is unique and shows long-lasting gene expression in cardiomyocytes up to 28 days after exposure. Additionally proteins involved in signal transduction and transcriptional activation via DNA binding play a role in the response to high charge (Z) and energy (E) particles (HZE).

The Rapid Freeze hardware freezes mouse tissues (Glovebox freezer) and whole carcasses (Cryochiller) at rates closely mimicking those attained with immersion in liquid nitrogen. Because this hardware will be used extensively on future rodent research missions it is crucial to understand whether or not it preserves signals in gene expression data in order to maximize the value of these rare and expensive spaceflight experiments.

After 25 days on-orbit half of the mice of each strain were euthanized on the ISS with Ketamine/Xylazine/Acepromazine and cardiac puncture after which carcasses were segmented in three sections and preserved in RNA later. After 75-76 days the remaining 5 animals from each group were euthanized and processed in the same manner. The 25-day dissected carcasses returned on SpX-15 and the 75-day dissected carcasses returned on SpX-16. In addition to the Flight group three ground control groups were also part of the study: Basal (representing the pre-launch state) Vivarium (standard vivarium housing for the same duration of time as flight) and Ground (same habitat in the International Space Station Environment Simulator ISSES). Twenty mice (10 of each strain) were included in each of these control groups which were euthanized and processed on the same schedule and in the same manner as the flight samples. Dissections for tissues from all experimental groups were completed by the PI groups along with NASA  s Biospecimen Sharing Program in February 2019. GeneLab received kidneys from thirty-eight C57BL/6J mice: 9 Basal 5 Ground (25 days) 4 Ground (75 days) 5 Flight (25 days) 5 Flight (75 days) 5 Vivarium (25 days) 5 Vivarium (75 days).

Immunosuppression during spaceflight is a major barrier to safe long-term human space habitation and travel. The goals of these experiments were to prove that uG was the cause of impaired T cell activation during spaceflight as well as understand the mechanisms controlling early T cell activation. T cells from 4 human donors were stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA) and anti-CD28 onboard the International Space Station (ISS). An onboard centrifuge was used to generate a 1g simultaneous control to isolate the effects of uG from other variables of spaceflight. Microarray expression analysis after 1.5 hours of activation demonstrated that mg- and 1g-activated T cells had distinct patterns of global gene expression and identified 47 genes that were significantly differentially down-regulated in uG. Importantly several key immediate early genes were inhibited in uG. T cells were isolated from human volunteers. T cells from each donor were kept separate and loaded into individual chambers in separate cassettes for the following treatments: uG non-activated uG activated and 1g activated. Therefore samples represent biological triplicates. Experimental units were launched into space and placed into the KUBIK facility onboard the International Space Station. The 1g units were placed in the central centrifuge positions and centrifuged with an applied 1g force. The uG units were place in the static positions for continued uG exposure. After 30 minutes of pre-incubation uG non-activated units were fixed by addition of RNALater (QIAGEN Valencia CA) removed from the incubator and stored in 4 xc2 xb0C. The uG and 1g activated units were injected with final concentration 10mg/ml Con A and 4mg/ml anti-CD28. These cassettes were replaced into KUBIK on either the centrifuge or static positions and activated for 1.5 hours. Activation was stopped with the addition of RNALater and the units were then moved to 4 xc2 xb0C storage. All units were returned to Earth for analysis.","title":"T Cell Activation in Microgravity Compared to 1g (Earth  s) Gravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-13_nm4v-8d2h","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-13","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"T Cell Activation in Microgravity Compared to 1g (Earth  s) Gravity"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gazetteer-of-planetary-nomenclature-nasa-000003863","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1977-01-01/2014-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["wise","geography","nen","space science"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Jennifer Blue","hasEmail":"mailto:jblue@usgs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000038__63","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

To better prevent or eventually treat microgravity-induced muscle atrophy its underlying mechanisms have first to be characterized in detail. Using cutting-edge quantitative proteomics the aim of the present study was therefore to get an in depth view of the molecular regulations triggered by space conditions in skeletal muscles of mice during the 30-day flight of the BION-M1 biosatellite.

Understanding the long-term effects of isolation has relevance in a range of scenarios and it is well recognized that a better understanding of the relationship between environmental exposure and the epigenome can lead to more effective preventive measures. Here we conduct a longitudinal epigenetic mood state and biochemical profiling of 6 crew members in an experiment simulating a 520-day mission to Mars. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles. Firstly we found that long-term isolation can induce global DNA methylation remodeling and this change seems to be an active adaptation (rather than a random process or a by-product of the isolation). This study is the first to demonstrate the dynamic relationship between global epigenetic remodeling and isolation-induced mood state and biochemical changes. Secondly by considering the location of methylation sites within the genome and using gene-pathway annotation we were able to identify pathways that were significantly enriched in methylation events and consider their association with specific function and the timeline of the mission. Thirdly via our definition of epi-entropy a measure of entropy adapted to methylation events we observed that the methylation remodeling produced a marked reduction in epi-entropy. Results suggest that DNA methylation change is an indicator of change rather than its by-product i.e. there is a psychology-epigenome-metabolism model of long-term depression; DNA methylation programs the environment signal into the epigenome which is subsequently transformed into the biochemical output and health outcome. Thus longitudinal epigenetic profiling could code the effect of isolation and act as early indicators of latent health outcome. A longitudinal epigenetic mood state and biochemical profiling of 6 crew members in an experiment simulating a 520-day mission to Mars. 36 samples of blood cell DNA methylation profiling were obtained by Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip across 6 sampling points during the 520 days mission for all of the 6 crew members.","title":"Dynamic nature of epigenetic patterns observed during the Mars 520-d mission simulation - nasa_genelab_GLDS-140_p9x5-mwci","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-140","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Dynamic nature of epigenetic patterns observed during the Mars 520-d mission simulation"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/effect-of-a-91-day-long-stay-in-weightlessness-on-the-international-space-station-on-mouse","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["spaceflight","p-mtab-40824","p-mtab-40820","p-mtab-40822","genotype","nucleic acid extraction protocol","p-mtab-40821","p-mtab-40823","nucleic acid labeling protocol","array scanning and feature extraction protocol","treatment protocol","nucleic acid hybridization to array protocol"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-61_pd5c-4fmg","description":"Comparitive gene expression in skin between mice maintained in microgravity (0g) and normogravity (1g) environment.

Consequently we used advanced proteomics analysis of femur bone and marrow of mice flown for one month on board the BION-M1 biosatellite to determine whether extreme conditions encountered during a real spaceflight affect B cell development in mice and to examine reversibility of the effects upon return to Earth. Our data revealed that adverse effects on B lymphopoiesis were more marked one week after landing and that this phenomenon was associated with a 41% reduction of B cells in the spleen.

Our aim was to assess whether the microgravity environment of spaceflight could induce virulence traits in P. aeruginosa. To this end P. aeruginosa cultures were grown in space and the expression profile was compared with ground control samples (both in biological triplicate). Characterization of bacterial behavior in the microgravity environment of spaceflight is of importance towards risk assessment and prevention of infectious disease during long-term missions. Further this research field unveils new insights into connections between low fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process in vivo and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the global transcriptomic and proteomic response of an opportunistic pathogen that is actually found in the space habitat Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins with Hfq identified as a global transcriptional regulator in the response to this environment. Since Hfq was also induced in spaceflight-grown Salmonella typhimurium Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator across the bacterial species border. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight conditions were the lecA and lecB lectins and the rhamnosyltransferase (rhlA) involved in the production of rhamnolipids. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data of this organism grown in microgravity-analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology. Interesting similarities were observed among others with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen utilization. While LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight adopted an anaerobic mode of growth in which denitrification was presumably most prominent. Differences in hardware between spaceflight and LSMMG experiments in combination with more pronounced low fluid shear and mixing in spaceflight when compared to LSMMG conditions were hypothesized to be at the origin of these observations. Collectively our data suggest that spaceflight conditions could induce the transition of P. aeruginosa from an opportunistic organism to potential pathogen results that are of importance for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention both during spaceflight missions and in the clinic.","title":"Transcriptional and proteomic response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to spaceflight conditions involves Hfq regulation and reveals a role for oxygen - nasa_genelab_GLDS-15_piua-q5gx","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-15","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Transcriptional and proteomic response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to spaceflight conditions involves Hfq regulation and reveals a role for oxygen"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/transcription-profiling-by-array-of-the-response-of-arabidopsis-cultivar-columbia-etiolate","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["data transformation","grow","p-mtab-25691","p-mtab-25689","p-mtab-25692","p-mtab-25693","p-mtab-25688","organism part","bioassay_data_transformation","cosmic radiation","radiation dosimetry","labeling","nucleic_acid_extraction","hybridization","reverse_transcription","spaceflight","p-mtab-25690","genelab microarray data processing protocol"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-17_ppbd-p394","description":"We address a key baseline question of whether gene expression changes are induced by the orbital environment and then we ask whether undifferentiated cells cells presumably lacking the typical gravity response mechanisms perceive spaceflight. Arabidopsis seedlings and undifferentiated cultured Arabidopsis cells were launched in April 2010 as part of the BRIC-16 flight experiment on STS-131. Biologically replicated DNA microarray and averaged RNA digital transcript profiling revealed several hundred genes in seedlings and cell cultures that were significantly affected by launch and spaceflight. The response was moderate in seedlings; only a few genes were induced by more than 7-fold and the overall intrinsic expression level for most differentially expressed genes was low. In contrast cell cultures displayed a more dramatic response with dozens of genes showing this level of differential expression a list comprised primarily of heat shock-related and stress-related genes. This baseline transcriptome profiling of seedlings and cultured cells confirms the fundamental hypothesis that survival of the spaceflight environment requires adaptive changes that are both governed and displayed by alterations in gene expression. The comparison of intact plants with cultures of undifferentiated cells confirms a second hypothesis: undifferentiated cells can detect spaceflight in the absence of specialized tissue or organized developmental structures known to detect gravity.","title":"Transcription profiling by array of the response of Arabidopsis cultivar Columbia etiolated seedlings and undifferentiated tissue culture cells to the spaceflight environment - nasa_genelab_GLDS-17_ppbd-p394","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-17","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Transcription profiling by array of the response of Arabidopsis cultivar Columbia etiolated seedlings and undifferentiated tissue culture cells to the spaceflight environment"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/transcriptomic-analysis-of-quadriceps-from-mice-subjected-to-simulated-spaceflight-euthana","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid extraction","carcass preservation method","data transformation","dissection condition","euthanasia","euthanasia animal","euthanasia method","genelab rnaseq data processing protocol","library construction","nucleic acid sequencing","sample collection","spike-in control","spike-in control protocol","tissue preservation method"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-236_pqdh-jg7d","description":"To understand the molecular mechanisms affected by spaceflight it is essential to achieve high quality sample preservation on-orbit for downstream gene expression analysis.

This study extends the sample preservation study performed by GeneLab in GLDS-49 which examined conditions used for the RR-1 mission to include conditions used for multiple RR missions and is designed to help determine factors which may confound data analysis. To determine whether these various factors affect changes in gene expression this ground-based study generated gene expression profiles measured by RNAseq from the quadriceps of 20-21 week-old female C57BL/6J mice. Multiple interacting factors were investigated: 1) To understand how euthanasia protocols affect gene expression when mouse carcasses are slow frozen mice were euthanized by either euthasol injection ketamine/xylazine injection or CO2 inhalation and carcasses slow frozen on dry-ice mimicking carcass preservation in the MELFI on the ISS. Carcasses were thawed and RNA extracted from quadriceps; 2) To understand how carcass preservation protocols affect gene expression mice were euthanized with euthasol and carcasses preserved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen slow freezing on dry ice or immersion in RNAlater following three-way segmentation.

Ionizing radiation (IR) both a carcinogen and a therapeutic agent induces TGFbeta activation in vivo. We now show that IR sensitizes human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) to undergo TGFbeta-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Non-malignant HMEC (MCF10A HMT3522 S1 and 184v) were irradiated with 2 Gy shortly after attachment in monolayer culture or treated with a low concentration of TGFbeta (0.4 ng/ml) or double-treated. All double-treated (IR+TGFbeta) HMEC underwent a morphological shift from cuboidal to spindle-shaped. This phenotype was accompanied by decreased expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin beta-catenin and ZO-1 remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and increased expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin fibronectin and vimentin. Furthermore double-treatment increased cell motility promoted invasion and disrupted acinar morphogenesis of cells subsequently plated in Matrigel. Neither radiation nor TGFbeta alone elicited EMT even though IR increased chronic TGFbeta signaling and activity. Gene expression profiling revealed that double treated cells exhibit a specific 10-gene signature associated with Erk/MAPK signaling. We hypothesized that IR-induced MAPK activation primes non-malignant HMEC to undergo TGFbeta-mediated EMT. Consistent with this Erk phosphorylation were transiently induced by irradiation persisted in irradiated cells treated with TGFbeta and treatment with U0126 a Mek inhibitor blocked the EMT phenotype. Together these data demonstrate that the interactions between radiation-induced signaling pathways elicit heritable phenotypes that could contribute to neoplastic progression. Experiment Overall Design: Nonmalignant human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells (passages 106 and 108) were seeded at cloning density in 35mm dishes (10^5 cells/dish). Cell culture medium consisted of 3ml/dish of MGEM serum free medium (Cambrex Inc.) supplemented or not with 400pg/ml recombinant Transforming Growth Factor-beta. Cells were irradiated or not 5h post plating using 160 KV X-ray with a total dose of 2Gy. Sham IR-treated TGFbeta-treated and double-treated (IR+TGFbeta) MCF10A cells were harvested 8 days post-IR. Briefly cells were washed with PBS denatured in Trizol scraped off the dish and subjected to chloroform extraction. After centrifugation the upper phase was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol. RNA precipitates were resuspended in RNase free water and further purified on RNeasy columns (Qiagen Germany). RNA quality was assessed on an Agilent Bio-Analyzer. The dataset analyzed by microarray included biological duplicates for each treatment in two independent experiments and three sham treated samples. Microarray data were generated at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Molecular Profiling Laboratory (http://hta.lbl.gov) using a high-throughput automated GeneChip system (Affymetrix). Briefly target preparation HT_HG-U133A array plate hybridization setup washing and staining were performed on an Affymetrix robotic system (GCAS) using version 2.1 protocols. Scanning (protocol version 2.2.09) was performed on a CCD-based high throughput scanner (Affymetrix). Samples were analyzed and clustered with the (UNO) One Color GenetrafficTM software version 3.2-12 (Iobion Informatics LLC Stratagene La Jolla CA). Genes whose expression was specifically altered by treatment were defined as those in which dye ratio was more than 1.75-fold (mean log2ratio>0.8) from baseline in at least three out of the four treated samples compared to the three sham samples. Significance analysis tests (p<0.05) were performed using Excel between sham samples and either IR TGFbeta or TGFbeta+IR samples.","title":"Transcription profiling of human MCF10A cells subjected to ionizing radiation and treatment with transforming growth factor beta-1 - nasa_genelab_GLDS-78_pquk-qkyu","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-78","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Transcription profiling of human MCF10A cells subjected to ionizing radiation and treatment with transforming growth factor beta-1"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/response-of-the-epi-200-human-3-d-skin-model-to-high-and-low-doses-of-protons-nasagenelabg","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["p-gse16935-7","nucleic acid hybridization","p-gse16935-1","p-gse16935-2","p-gse16935-3","p-gse16935-4","labeling","data transformation","data collection","p-gse16935-5","p-gse16935-6","normalization data transformation","p-gse16935-8","radiation","rna extraction","sample collection","timepoint","treatment protocol"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-92_pr2n-gka9","description":"Accumulating data suggest that the biological responses to high and low doses of radiation are qualitatively different necessitating the direct study of low dose responses.

But only one mouse returned to the Earth alive. Whole brain was sampled from the mouse killed by inhalation of carbon dioxide at the Life Sciences Support Facility of Kennedy Space Center within 3-4 hours after landing. After the spaceflight experiment the on-ground experiment was also carried out at the Advanced Biotechnology Center in Genova Italy.

Another mouse was housed in normal vivarium cage as the laboratory control (LC). Amount of food and water supplementation and environmental conditions were simulated as the flight group. After 3 months brain was sampled from one mouse in group GC and LC respectively. Comprehensive analyses of gene expression were performed in the right brain. Total of 4,000 genes were analyzed. The expression levels of 60 genes significantly changed in response to SF compared with LC and/or GC. The 15 and 16 genes were up- (> 2 folds) and down-regulated (< 0.5 folds) respectively following SF vs. GC. The levels of 58 genes were significantly altered by housing in MDS in space and/or on the ground. Forty seven and 11 genes were significantly up- and down-regulated vs. LC. Twenty seven out of these genes responded to caging in MDS both in space and on the ground. Further 31 genes were influenced by housing in MDS on the Earth.

A total of sixteen human samples representing radiation exposure at levels 0 Gy 0.3 Gy 1.5 Gy and 3.0 Gy at time point 1 hour (hr) post-exposure were constructed. Blood samples were extracted from four human volunteers and were irradiated. Leukocytes were extracted and gene expression was measured. Samples for all four volunteers were measured at 1 hr for all four dose levels resulting in four replicates at each dose level.

Ionizing radiation (IR) both a carcinogen and a therapeutic agent induces TGFbeta activation in vivo. We now show that IR sensitizes human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) to undergo TGFbeta-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Non-malignant HMEC (MCF10A HMT3522 S1 and 184v) were irradiated with 2 Gy shortly after attachment in monolayer culture or treated with a low concentration of TGFbeta (0.4 ng/ml) or double-treated. All double-treated (IR+TGFbeta) HMEC underwent a morphological shift from cuboidal to spindle-shaped. This phenotype was accompanied by decreased expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin beta-catenin and ZO-1 remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and increased expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin fibronectin and vimentin. Furthermore double-treatment increased cell motility promoted invasion and disrupted acinar morphogenesis of cells subsequently plated in Matrigel. Neither radiation nor TGFbeta alone elicited EMT even though IR increased chronic TGFbeta signaling and activity. Gene expression profiling revealed that double treated cells exhibit a specific 10-gene signature associated with Erk/MAPK signaling. We hypothesized that IR-induced MAPK activation primes non-malignant HMEC to undergo TGFbeta-mediated EMT. Consistent with this Erk phosphorylation were transiently induced by irradiation persisted in irradiated cells treated with TGFbeta and treatment with U0126 a Mek inhibitor blocked the EMT phenotype. Together these data demonstrate that the interactions between radiation-induced signaling pathways elicit heritable phenotypes that could contribute to neoplastic progression. Experiment Overall Design: Nonmalignant human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells (passages 106 and 108) were seeded at cloning density in 35mm dishes (10^5 cells/dish). Cell culture medium consisted of 3ml/dish of MGEM serum free medium (Cambrex Inc.) supplemented or not with 400pg/ml recombinant Transforming Growth Factor-beta. Cells were irradiated or not 5h post plating using 160 KV X-ray with a total dose of 2Gy. Sham IR-treated TGFbeta-treated and double-treated (IR+TGFbeta) MCF10A cells were harvested 8 days post-IR. Briefly cells were washed with PBS denatured in Trizol scraped off the dish and subjected to chloroform extraction. After centrifugation the upper phase was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol. RNA precipitates were resuspended in RNase free water and further purified on RNeasy columns (Qiagen Germany). RNA quality was assessed on an Agilent Bio-Analyzer. The dataset analyzed by microarray included biological duplicates for each treatment in two independent experiments and three sham treated samples. Microarray data were generated at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Molecular Profiling Laboratory (http://hta.lbl.gov) using a high-throughput automated GeneChip system (Affymetrix). Briefly target preparation HT_HG-U133A array plate hybridization setup washing and staining were performed on an Affymetrix robotic system (GCAS) using version 2.1 protocols. Scanning (protocol version 2.2.09) was performed on a CCD-based high throughput scanner (Affymetrix). Samples were analyzed and clustered with the (UNO) One Color GenetrafficTM software version 3.2-12 (Iobion Informatics LLC Stratagene La Jolla CA). Genes whose expression was specifically altered by treatment were defined as those in which dye ratio was more than 1.75-fold ( mean log2ratio >0.8) from baseline in at least three out of the four treated samples compared to the three sham samples.

The experiment involved an implantable subcutaneous nanochannel delivery system (nDS; between scapula) which delivered the drug formoterol (FMT; a selective Beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist) over the course of time. To this end a cohort of forty 32-weeks-old female C57BL/6NTac mice were either sham operated or implanted with vehicle or treatment-filled nDS launched in two Transporters (20 mice per Transporter) on SpaceX-13 on December 15 2017. They were transferred to Rodent Habitats onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and maintained in microgravity for 29 days (N=20 Live Animal Return [LAR]) or >50 days (N=20 ISS Terminal). After 29 days the 20 LAR animals were returned live to back to Earth on January 13 2018,. After splashdown the animals were ambulatory on-ground for ~4 days until all subjects were processed during one day of dissections. There were two Baseline groups of animals sacrificed (LAR Baseline & FLT Baseline; N=20; 40 animals; ~36 weeks old) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC; 12/9/17). A Ground Control group mimicked the Flight LAR group which was housed at KSC then shipped alive to Novartis   Facilities where both the LAR and LAR Ground Control groups were processed (~41 weeks old; 1/16/18). All were anesthetized with isoflurane blood samples were obtained by closed-chest cardiac puncture and the animals were euthanized by exsanguination and thoracotomy. The 20 ISS Terminal mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine over the course of a four days of dissections (2/6/18 until 2/9/18; 53-56 days after launch; 44 weeks old at time of on-orbit dissections). Blood samples and euthanasia were conducted the same as LAR and Baseline. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection the ISS-terminal animal carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return. The ISS-terminal Ground Controls (at KSC) followed the same euthanasia timeline methods and preservation. The final processing of frozen ISS-terminal frozen ISS-terminal Ground Controls and frozen 0-day FLT baseline animals were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute in Houston TX (5/21/18 until 5/24/18). GeneLab received samples of liver from only sham treated animals (no drug treated animals) from the following groups Flight: LAR (n=10) ISS Terminal (n= 10); Ground Controls: LAR GC (N=9) ISS Terminal GC (N=10) LAR Baseline (n=10) ISS Terminal Baseline (n=10).

However the more subtle biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms are difficult to measure in a systematic unbiased manner. Here we test the utility of the molecularly barcoded yeast deletion collection to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of microgravity on a model organism. We developed robust hardware to screen in parallel the complete collection of ~4800 homozygous and ~5900 heterozygous (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes) yeast deletion strains each carrying unique DNA that acts as strain identifiers. We compared strain fitness for the homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion collections grown in spaceflight and ground as well as plus and minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride providing a second additive stressor. The genome-wide sensitivity profiles obtained from these treatments were then queried for their similarity to a compendium of drugs whose effects on the yeast collection have been previously reported. We found that the effects of spaceflight have high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents and changes in redox state suggesting mechanisms by which spaceflight may negatively affect cell fitness.","title":"Genes Required for Survival in Microgravity Revealed by Genome-Wide Yeast Deletion Collections Cultured during Spaceflight - nasa_genelab_GLDS-58_qbdj-sidf","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-58","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Genes Required for Survival in Microgravity Revealed by Genome-Wide Yeast Deletion Collections Cultured during Spaceflight"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/calipso-imaging-infrared-radiometer-l2-data-swath-v2-02-nasa-0000141","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"2006-06-13/2008-09-13","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["cloud","eos","aerosol","climate","atmospheric science","radiation","satellite"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"John M.

High altitude for example presents terrestrial hypobaria always with hypoxia as a component stress since the relative partial pressure of O2 is constant in the atmosphere. Laboratory-controlled hypobaria however allows the dissection of pressure effects away from the effects typically associated with altitude in particular hypoxia as the partial pressure of O2 can be varied. In this study whole transcriptomes of plants grown in ambient (97 kPa/pO2 = 21 kPa) atmospheric conditions were compared to those of plants transferred to five different atmospheres of varying pressure and oxygen composition for 24 h: 50 kPa/pO2 = 10 kPa 25 kPa/pO2 = 5 kPa 50 kPa/pO2 = 21 kPa 25 kPa/pO2 = 21 kPa or 97 kPa/pO2 = 5 kPa. The plants exposed to these environments were 10 day old Arabidopsis seedlings grown vertically on hydrated nutrient plates. In addition 5 day old plants were also exposed for 24 h to the 50 kPa and ambient environments to evaluate age-dependent responses. The gene expression profiles from roots and shoots showed that the hypobaric response contained more complex gene regulation than simple hypoxia and that adding back oxygen to normoxic conditions did not completely alleviate gene expression changes in hypobaric responses.","title":"Dissecting Low Atmospheric Pressure Stress: Transcriptome Responses to the Components of Hypobaria in Arabidopsis [Experiment 1] - nasa_genelab_GLDS-134_qf2e-v24s","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-134","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Dissecting Low Atmospheric Pressure Stress: Transcriptome Responses to the Components of Hypobaria in Arabidopsis [Experiment 1]"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/calipso-imaging-infrared-radiometer-l2-data-track-v3-02","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"2011-01-01/2013-02-28","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["climate","atmospheric science","aerosol","satellite","radiation","cloud","eos"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"John M.

Proton irradiation on tumors induces biological modulations including inhibition of angiogenic and immune factors critical to     hallmark     processes impacting tumor development in addition to physical targeting advantages. These advantages have provided promising results for proton therapy in cancer. Additionally protons have implications for carcinogenesis risk of space travel (due to the high proportion of high energy protons in space radiation). Through a systems biology approach we investigated how host tissue (i.e. splenic tissue) of tumor-bearing mice is altered with age with or without whole-body proton exposure. Transcriptome analysis was performed on splenic tissue from adolescent (68 day) versus old (736 day) C57BL/6 male mice injected with Lewis lung carcinoma cells with or without three fractionations of 0.5Gy (1GeV) proton irradiation. Global transcriptome analysis indicated that proton irradiation of adolescent hosts caused significant signaling changes within splenic tissues that support carcinogenesis within the mice as compared to old subjects. Increases in cell cycling and immunosuppression in irradiated adolescent hosts with CDK2 MCM7 CD74 and RUVBL2 as the key players were involved in the regulatory changes in host environment response (i.e. spleen). These results suggest a significant biological component to proton irradiation operative through host age that would indicate a modulation of host  s ability to support carcinogenesis in adolescence and the bestowal of resistance to immunosuppression carcinogenesis and genetic perturbation by old age.","title":"Proton Irradiation Impacts Age Driven Modulations of Cancer Progression Influenced by Immune System Transcriptome Modifications from Splenic Tissue - nasa_genelab_GLDS-89_qh9j-6cmg","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-89","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Proton Irradiation Impacts Age Driven Modulations of Cancer Progression Influenced by Immune System Transcriptome Modifications from Splenic Tissue"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gateway-to-astronaut-photography-of-earth-nasa-00000378","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1977-01-01/1996-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["nen","space science","geography","wise"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"William Stefanov","hasEmail":"mailto:jsc-earthweb@nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000037__8","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

Thus, a whole genome micro-array experiment was conducted to identify genes that may be involved in the observed effect on bone formation.","title":"Exposure of zebrafish larvae to 3g and 5g hyper gravity between 5-6 days post-fertilization. - nasa_genelab_GLDS-123_qr4c-tdt5","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-123","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Exposure of zebrafish larvae to 3g and 5g hyper gravity between 5-6 days post-fertilization."}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gene-expression-profiling-of-saccharomyces-cerevisiae-irradiated-by-high-let-radiations-na","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["normalization data transformation","nucleic acid hybridization","rna extraction","labeling","growth and treatment protocol","data collection","radiation ionzing","data transformation"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-97_qryz-r9d3","description":"Ionizing radiations are categorized by linear energy transfer (LET) into low-LET and high-LET. High-LET is considered to have a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) than low-LET radiations. However the details of the effects have not been clearly determined. The aim of this study was to characterize the difference between high-LET and low LET radiations. The global effects of the three types of high-LET radiations (fast neutron heavy ion (C) and thermal neutron) were compared with the low-LET radiation (gamma ray) using yeast DNA microarrays. Highly induced genes by the three types of high-LET radiations were those genes related to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress was one of the common factors associated with the four types of radiations. Oxidative stress induced by high-LET radiations may be more serious than that induced by gamma rays. Additionally genes related to protein synthesis and the ubiquitin and proteasome system were detected. This suggests that more protein damages can be induced by high-LET radiation that denatures the proteins in yeast cells. The genes specifically altered by each type of high-LET radiation were also studied. Overall design: This series contains 4 kinds of irradiation-induced gene expression profiles. Triplicates hybridization was done in each irradiation exposure and each array have high and low power scanned data respectively. All biological samples were collected independently.","title":"Gene-expression profiling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae irradiated by high-LET radiations - nasa_genelab_GLDS-97_qryz-r9d3","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-97","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Gene-expression profiling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae irradiated by high-LET radiations"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/heart-flies-effect-of-microgravity-on-heart-function-in-drosophila","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["spaceflight   genotype","treatment protocol   sample collection protocol   nucleic acid extraction   library construction   nucleic acid sequencing"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-347_qxqy-gj39","description":"Canton S laboratory wildtype lines (Bloomington Stock Center) and a K+ channel mutant seizure (seizurets1 a gift from Dr. Barry Ganetsky published in Titus et al. 1997) a homolog of human hERG were used in this study.

Our results show that 42 miRNAs were differentially expressed in MMG-incubated PBLs compared with 1g-incubated ones. Among these miR-9-5p miR-9-3p miR-155-5p miR-150-3p and miR-378-3p were the most dysregulated. To improve the detection of functional miRNA-mRNA pairs we performed gene expression profiles on the same samples assayed for miRNA profiling and we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression data. The functional classification of miRNA-correlated genes evidenced significant enrichments in the biological processes of immune/inflammatory response signal transduction regulation of response to stress regulation of programmed cell death and regulation of cell proliferation. We identified the correlation between miR-9-3p miR-155-5p miR-150-3p and miR-378-3p expression with that of genes involved in immune/inflammatory response (eg. IFNG and IL17F) apoptosis (eg. PDCD4 and PTEN) and cell proliferation (eg. NKX3-1 and GADD45A). Experimental assays of cell viability and apoptosis induction validated the results obtained by bioinformatics analyses demonstrating that in human PBLs the exposure to reduced gravitational force increases the frequency of apoptosis and decreases cell proliferation. microRNA expression profiling were carried out on total RNA extracted from PBLs of twelve healthy donors at the end of 24h-incubation time in MMG and in 1g conditions. Analyses were performed by using the Human miRNA Microarray kit (V2) (Agilent Technologies) that allows the detection of 723 known human (miRBase v.10.1) and 76 human viral miRNAs. By comparing the expression profile of MMG-incubated vs. 1g-incubated PBLs of the same donor we found 42 differentially expressed miRNAs 25 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated.","title":"microRNA expression profiles in human peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured in modeled microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-55_r33p-25na","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-55","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"microRNA expression profiles in human peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured in modeled microgravity"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/earth-nasa-00000338","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"2004-01-01/2005-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["climatology","radiometry","hdf5","power","education outreach","earth science","atmospheric science data center"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Robert O.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which mostly regulate gene expression by degrading the messages or inhibiting translation. Here we investigated changes in miRNA expression patterns after low (0.1 Gy) and high (2.0 Gy) doses of X-ray in human fibroblasts. At early (0.5 h) and late (6 and 24 h) time points irradiation caused qualitative and quantitative differences in the down-regulation of miRNA levels including miR-92b 137 660 and 656. A transient up-regulation of miRNAs was observed after 2 h post-irradiation following high doses of radiation including miR-558 and 662. MicroRNA levels were inversely correlated with targets from mRNA and proteomic profiling after 2.0 Gy of radiation. MicroRNAs miR-579 608 548-3p and 585 are noted for targeting genes involved in radioresponsive mechanisms such as cell cycle checkpoint and apoptosis. We suggest here a model in which miRNAs may act as hub regulators of specific cellular responses immediately down-regulated so as to stimulate DNA repair mechanisms followed by up-regulation involved in suppressing apoptosis for cell survival. Taken together miRNAs may mediate signaling pathways in sequential fashion in response to radiation and may serve as biodosimetric markers of radiation exposure.

Through a Systems Biology approach our previous NASA work has shown both TGF xce xb2 signaling pathways and miRNAs have a critical impact on defining health risks with and without space irradiation. We hypothesize that circulating microRNA (miRNA) signatures are driving microvascular disease and muscle degeneration associated with accelerating aging and will be enhanced by exposure to the space environment (radiation and microgravity). We investigated this hypothesis both in vivo and in vitro and test novel antagonist therapies to these miRNA signatures as countermeasures to reduce space radiation-induced health risks. A comprehensive Systems Biology approach was used to examine the influence by high atomic number by high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) (HZE) irradiation. To simulate low-dose exposure due to galactic cosmic rays (GCR) we used the ions energy and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula of 7 different ions to represent GCR (referred to as GCR sim model). To simulate high-dose radiation exposure due to solar particle events (SPE) we used an acute dose of SPE simulated beam at 1Gy which has energies ranging from 50MeV to 150MeV. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were utilized for irradiation with our established simulated microgravity model (hindlimb suspension model) and an in vitro 3D microvasculature tissue model under simulated microgravity (clinostat) conditions will also be irradiated. To expand on the circulating miRNA signature determined from our preliminary data we determined a group of conserved miRNAs which are commonly being regulated in the majority of the organs and tissues throughout the host using our established techniques. MiRNA-sequencing on serum (before IR and at time of sacrifice) liver heart and muscle tissue for all radiation groups revealed the key circulating miRNA signature (consisting of multiple miRNAs) impacting disease risk. Collectively understanding of how whole body space radiation impacts microvascular and tissue degeneration through circulating miRNAs will greatly enhance health risk prognostication and provide possible new mechanisms for protection against space radiation.","title":"miRNA signature detection and countermeasures against HZE radiation exposure for tissue degeneration-Plasma","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-336","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"miRNA signature detection and countermeasures against HZE radiation exposure for tissue degeneration-Plasma"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/microbial-observatory-iss-mo-draft-genome-sequence-of-two-aspergillus-fumigatus-strains-is","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid sequencing","library construction","nucleic acid extraction","nucleic acid extraction protocol","nucleic acid library construction protocol","nucleic acid sequencing protocol","sample collection","sample collection protocol","sample processing","sequence assembly","spaceflight"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-68_rjs4-kkmz","description":"Aspergillus fumigatus is a saprophytic filamentous fungus that is ubiquitous outdoors (soil decaying vegetation) and indoors (hospitals simulated closed habitats etc.).

The whole genome sequence analysis of ISSF 21 revealed increased number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) when compared to the reference A. fumigatus 293. Knowing that A. fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen and microgravity highly influences the antibiotic susceptibility and pathogenicity of microorganisms we examined pathogenicity of both ISS isolates using the zebrafish larval model.

This rapid effect on weight-bearing bones is also observed in astronauts who lose up to 2% of their bone mass per month spent in Space. Despite important implications for Spaceflight travellers and bedridden patients on Earth the exact mechanisms involved in disuse osteoporosis have not been elucidated. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulates many physiological processes including skeletal development and has been proposed as a gravisensor. To investigate the role of PTHrP in microgravity-induced bone loss trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) from Pthrp+/+ and -/- mice were exposed to simulated microgravity for 6 days. Viability of TOs decreased in inverse proportion to PTHrP expression levels. Microarray analysis of Pthrp+/+ TOs after 6 days at 0g revealed expression changes in genes encoding prolactins,apoptosis and survival molecules bone metabolism and extra-cellular matrix composition proteins chemokines IGF family and Wnt-related signalling molecules. Importantly 88% of 0g-induced expression changes in Pthrp+/+ cells overlap those observed in Pthrp-/- cells in normal gravity. Pulsatile treatment with PTHrP1-36 peptide during microgravity exposure reversed a large proportion of 0g-induced changes in Pthrp+/+ TOs. Our results confirm PTHrP efficacy as an anabolic agent to prevent microgravity-induced cell death in TOs. Total RNA samples extracted from Pthrp+/+and -/- trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) exposed for 6 days to simulated 0g in Synthecon rotating cell or left 6 days in culture at 1g. Cells had either been treated with a pulsatile treatment (2 h/day) of PTHrP1-36 peptide (10-8M) or received a change in growth medium. In total: 8 different conditions with 2 replicates each i.e. Pthrp+/+ TOs at 0g or 1g with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment and Pthrp-/- TOs at 0g or 1 g,with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment.","title":"The Role of PTHrP in Osteoblast Response to Microgravity: Implications for Osteoporosis Development. - nasa_genelab_GLDS-107_rp24-jkbu","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-107","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"The Role of PTHrP in Osteoblast Response to Microgravity: Implications for Osteoporosis Development."}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/woman-skeletal-muscle-transcriptome-with-bed-rest-and-countermeasures-nasagenelabglds-51rp","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["p-gse14798-5","p-gse14798-4","p-gse14798-3","image_aquisition","p-gse14798-6","bioassay_data_transformation","p-gse14798-2","exercise","tissue","feature_extraction","hybridization","labeling","bed rest","nucleic_acid_extraction","nutrition","p-gse14798-1"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-51_rpve-yf52","description":"Microgravity has a dramatic impact on human physiology illustrated in particular with skeletal muscle impairment. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms leading to loss of muscle mass and structural disorders is necessary for the definition of efficient clinical and spaceflight countermeasures. We investigated the effects of long-term bed rest on transcriptome of soleus (SOL) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles in healthy women (BRC group n=8) and the potential beneficial impact of protein supplementation (BRN group n=8) and of a combined resistance and aerobic training (BRE group n=8). Gene expression profiles were obtained using an in-house made microarray containing 6681 muscles-relevant genes. A two-class statistical analysis was applied on the 2103 genes with consolidated expression. We identified 472 and 207 modified genes respectively for SOL and VL in BRC group. Further clustering approaches identifying relevant biological mechanisms or pathways underlined five main subclusters. Three are composed almost of upregulated genes involved mainly in nucleic acid and protein metabolism and two composed almost of downregulated genes involved in energy metabolism. Exercise countermeasure demonstrated a drastic compensatory effect decreasing the number of differentially-expressed genes by 89 and 96% in SOL and VL. In contrast nutrition countermeasure had a moderate effect and decreased the number of differentially-expressed genes by 40 and 25% in SOL and VL. Our results allowed reporting a systematic global and comprehensive view of long-term woman muscle atrophy and brought new lights and insights for space environment and for women who undergo a long-term clinical bed rest. Biological samples were collected from Pre- and Post- bed rest (BR) soleus and vastus lateralis biopsies of each subject from the three groups (bed rest only: BRC; Exercise: BRE; Nutrition: BRN). six technical replicate values (2 duplicate hybridizations a et b to chips with triplicate spots xxx) were obtained for each skeletal muscle sample.

However to date neither spaceflight results ground-based studies physical measurement techniques nor computational approaches have provided sufficient evidence needed to confirm this model. Gene expression data from the Antibiotic Effectiveness in Space (AES-1) experiment however have now allowed us to look into the biomolecular processes behind these observations and showed a systematic activation of glucose starvation and acid resistance genes. These results corroborate the reduced mass transport model proposed to govern bacterial responses to spaceflight. Furthermore the gene expression data suggests that metabolism was stimulated in space which could play a role in causing the observed increase in bacterial cell concentrations in microgravity.

There were two Baseline groups of animals sacrificed (LAR Baseline & FLT Baseline; N=20; 40 animals; ~36 weeks old) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC; 12/9/17). A Ground Control group mimicked the Flight LAR group which was housed at KSC then shipped alive to Novartis   facilities where both the LAR and LAR Ground Control groups were processed (~41 weeks old; 1/16/18). All were anesthetized with isoflurane blood samples were obtained by closed-chest cardiac puncture and the animals were euthanized by exsanguination and thoracotomy. The 20 ISS Terminal mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine over the course of a four days of dissections (2/6/18 until 2/9/18; 53-56 days after launch; 44 weeks old at time of on-orbit dissections). Blood samples and euthanasia were conducted the same as LAR and Baseline. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection the ISS-terminal animal carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return. The ISS-terminal Ground Controls (at KSC) followed the same euthanasia timeline methods and preservation. The final processing of frozen ISS-terminal frozen ISS-terminal Ground Controls and frozen 0-day FLT baseline animals were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute in Houston TX (5/21/18 until 5/24/18). GeneLab received samples of dorsal skin from only sham treated animals (no drug treated animals) from the following groups Flight: LAR (n=9) ISS Terminal (n=9); Ground Controls: LAR GC (N=9) ISS Terminal GC (N=10) LAR Baseline (n=10) ISS Terminal Baseline (n=6).

It is unknown to what extent the irradiated microenvironment contributes to the differential carcinogenic potential of densely ionizing radiation. To address this gap 10-week old BALB/c mice were irradiated with 100 cGy sparsely ionizing g-radiation or 10 30 or 80 cGy of densely ionizing 350 MeV/amu Si particles and transplanted 3 days later with syngeneic Trp53 null mammary fragments. Tumor appearance was monitored for 600 days. Tumors arising in Si-particle irradiated mice had a shorter median time to appearance grew faster and were more likely to metastasize. Most tumors arising in sham-irradiated mice were ER-positive pseudo-glandular and contained both basal keratin 14 and luminal keratin 8/18 cells (designated K14/18) while most tumors arising in irradiated hosts were K8/18 positive (designated K18) and ER negative. Comparison of K18 vs K14/18 tumor expression profiles showed that genes increased in K18 tumors were associated with ERBB2 and KRAS while decreased genes overlapped with those down regulated in metastasis and by loss of E-cadherin. Consistent with this K18 tumors grew faster than K14/18 tumors and more mice with K18 tumors developed lung metastases compared to mice with K14/18 tumors. However K18 tumors arising in Si-particle irradiated mice grew even faster and were more metastatic compared to control mice. A K18 Si-irradiated host profile was enriched in genes involved in mammary stem cells stroma and Notch signaling. Thus systemic responses to densely ionizing radiation enriches for a ER-negative K18-positive tumor whose biology is more aggressive compared to similar tumors arising in non-irradiated hosts. Key Words: ionizing radiation; breast cancer; heavy ion radiation;initiation; promotion 3 different dose of Si were used. Total RNA was extracted from mammary tumors derived from transplantations of non-irradiated p53null mammary fragments into irradiated hosts. We analyzed a total of 45 Trp53-null tumors: 18 from sham-irradiated hosts 9 from 10 cGy Si-irradiated hosts 10 from 30 cGy Si-irradiated hosts and 8 from irradiated hosts.","title":"Densely Ionizing Radiation Effects on the Microenvironment Promote Aggressive Trp53 Null Mammary Carcinomas - nasa_genelab_GLDS-74_s2yc-kgq9","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-74","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Densely Ionizing Radiation Effects on the Microenvironment Promote Aggressive Trp53 Null Mammary Carcinomas"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/re-adaption-on-earth-after-spaceflights-affects-the-mouse-liver-proteome","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["absorbed radiation dose","data transformation","spaceflight","sample collection","radiation dosimetry","mouse habitation protocol","mouse habitation","mass spectrometry","extraction","dissection timeline"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-209_s4pc-d8x9","description":"Harsh environmental conditions including microgravity and radiation during prolonged spaceflights are known to alter hepatic metabolism.

Utilizing shotgun mass spectrometry and label-free quantification we performed proteomic profiling to investigate mice livers from the spaceflight project  xe2 x80 x9cBion-M 1 xe2 x80 x9d. No significant alterations in protein levels were observed between control mice liver and spaceflight mice which is possibly caused by insufficient fold change detection combined with high variances within the groups. In contrast our results show that more than a third of the quantified protein levels are altered comparing the liver proteome of mice with and without re-adaption time after their spaceflight. Proteins related to amino acid metabolism showed higher levels after re-adaption which may indicate higher rates of gluconeogenesis. Members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pathway reconstitute their level after 7 days due to a decrease in fold change which indicates decreased signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Moreover bile acid secretion regenerates on Earth due to reconstitution of related transmembrane proteins and elevated levels of the drug-metabolising enzymes belonging to the CYP superfamily decrease 7 days after the spaceflight. Thus our study demonstrates reconstitution of pharmacological response and early signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease recover within 7 days whereas glucose uptake should be monitored due to alterations in gluconeogenesis.","title":"Re-Adaption on Earth after Spaceflights Affects the Mouse Liver Proteome","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-209","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Re-Adaption on Earth after Spaceflights Affects the Mouse Liver Proteome"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/calipso-lidar-l2-aerosol-layer-data-v2-01","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"2006-06-13/2008-09-13","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["satellite","aerosol","cloud","climate","eos","atmospheric science","radiation"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"John M.

While the flight experiment was performed in fully automated hardware inside the KUBIK incubator one group of control samples were incubated inside manually operated hardwares (flight control) and the other control group was incubated under routine laboratory conditions (lab control). The altered gene expression profile was analyzed by Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix) representing whole-transcript coverage. Each one of the 28853 genes is represented on the array by approximately 26 probes spread across the full length of the gene providing a more complete and more accurate picture of gene expression than the 3 xc3 x94 xc3 xb8 xce xa9 based expression array design. A few days of microgravity were sufficient to determinate at least at the molecular level an effect in the BMSC; this response expressed a stress condition able to determinate consequences on several compartments and cellular functions. In particular it seems to promote a gene expression known to be associated with neurogenic activity (e.g. axon guidance) perhaps promoting the BMSC capability to be committed in that direction. The osteo-induction by dexamethasone-based medium due to the short duration of stimulation did not have the possibility to manifest itself at the phenotypic level but only partially at the molecular level.","title":"Genechip analysis of bone marrow osteoprogenitors exposed to microgravity - nasa_genelab_GLDS-29_s637-vsjy","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-29","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Genechip analysis of bone marrow osteoprogenitors exposed to microgravity"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/transient-gene-expression-profile-changes-of-confluent-human-fibroblast-cells-in-spaceflig","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["mrna data transformation","mirna nucleic acid hybridization","data collection","data transformation","timepoint","sample collection","normalization data transformation","labeling","microgravity","normalization","mrna nucleic acid hybridization","nucleic acid hybridization","mirna data collection","mrna normalization data transformation","mirna data transformation","mirna labeling","mirna normalization","mrna labeling","mrna data collection","rna extraction"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-118_s7qc-medv","description":"Microgravity or an altered gravity environment from the static 1g has been shown to influence global gene expression patterns and protein levels in cultured cells or animals but it is unclear how these changes in gene and protein expressions are related to each other or are related to other factors regulating such changes.

We used flow cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during flight to define the differentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; including CD11b CD31 CD44 Ly6C Ly6G F4/80 Mac2 c-Fos as well as c-Fms. In addition RNA was preserved during the flight and was used to perform a gene microarray. We found that there were significant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth. We found that there were significant changes in the distribution of cells that expressed CD11b CD31 F4/80 Mac2 Ly6C and c-Fos. However there were no changes in c-Fms expression and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded differentiation during space flight. We also found a pattern of transcript levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome but increased proliferation by the bone marrow macrophages that were assayed after 14 days of space flight. There also was a surprising pattern of space flight influence on genes of the coagulation pathway.

We identified a novel role for RAD51 in innate immune response signaling. Defects in RAD51 lead to the accumulation of self-DNA in the cytoplasm triggering a STING-mediated innate immune response after replication stress and DNA damage. Our data suggest that in addition to playing roles in homologous recombination-mediated DNA double-strand break repair and replication fork processing RAD51 is also implicated in the suppression of innate immunity. Thus our study reveals a previously uncharacterized role of RAD51 in initiating immune signaling placing it at the hub of new interconnections between DNA replication DNA repair and immunity.

Calibration and navigation data, and instrument and selected spacecraft telemetry are also included. Level-1A data are used as input for geolocation, calibration, and processing.  <strong>Ocean Level-2 Data Products</strong> Each Level-2 product is generated from a corresponding Level-1A product.The main data contents of the product are the geophysical values for each pixel,derived from the Level-1A raw radiance counts by applying the sensor calibration, atmospheric corrections, and bio-optical algorithms. Each Level-2 product corresponds exactly in geographical coverage (scan-line and pixel extent) to that of its parent Level-1A product and is stored in one physical HDFfile.  <strong>Ocean Level-3 Binned Data Products</strong> Level-3 binned data products consist of the accumulated data for all Level-2 data corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, or a calendar year.  Each Level-3 binned data product is stored in one or more HDF files. Each multi-file product includes a main file containing all product-level metadata and data for each bin that are common to all the binned geophysical parameters, and multiple subordinate files, each of which contains data of one binned geophysical parameter for all bins. Subordinate files must be read in conjunction with the associated main file.  <strong>Ocean Level-3 Standard Mapped Image Products</strong> The Level-3 standard mapped image (SMI) products are image representations of binned data products generated from SeaWiFS, MODIS, OCTS or CZCS data. The data in each SMI product represents an image of the parameter specified by the global attribute Parameter. This object is a two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical (also known as Platte Carre) projection of the globe. The values can be stored as bytes, 2-byte integers, or 4- byte floats. The first two are scaled real values and may be converted projected to geophysical values using the global attributes Scaling, Scaling Equation, Base, Slope, and Intercept.  The standard SMI products are generated from binned data products, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: chlorophyll a concentration, angstrom coefficient, normalized water-leaving radiance at each visible wavelength, aerosol optical thickness, epsilon, and diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm. For MODIS, products are generated for sea surface temperature (SST), 4 micron SST (SST4) and nighttime SST (NSST). Thus, each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products. Each SMI product contains one image of a geophysical parameter and is stored in one physical HDF file.","title":"Ocean Color","programCode":["026:000"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/","mediaType":"text/html"}],"describedBy":"http://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/PRODUCTS/product_level_desc.html","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular"},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/microbial-observatory-iss-mo-study-of-bsl-2-bacterial-isolates-from-the-international-spac","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["sequence assembly","nucleic acid sequencing","truseq dna pcr-free was used as per manufacturer instruction","library construction","sample collection","illumina nextseq","sample collection was done using sterile moisten wipes","microgravity","nucleic acid extraction","nucleic acid extraction was done usinq qiagen dna extraction kit as per manufacturer instruction","sequence assembly using  a5 genome assembler"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-67_stcs-xp8m","description":"In an on-going Microbial Observatory experimental investigation on the International Space Station (ISS) multiple bacterial isolates of Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) were isolated and identified.

Transforming growth factor  xce xb2 (TGF xce xb2) is an immunosuppressive cytokine that is activated by RT and inhibits the antigen-presenting function of dendritic cells and the differentiation of effector CD8+ T cells. Here we tested the hypothesis that TGF xce xb2 hinders the ability of RT to promote anti-tumor immunity. Development of tumor-specific immunity was examined in a pre-clinical model of metastatic breast cancer. Mice bearing established 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma treated with pan-isoform specific TGF xce xb2 neutralizing antibody 1D11 showed significantly improved control of the irradiated tumor and non-irradiated metastases but no effect in the absence of RT. Notably whole tumor transcriptional analysis demonstrated the selective upregulation of genes associated with immune-mediated rejection only in tumors of mice treated with RT+TGF xce xb2 blockade. Mice treated with RT+TGF xce xb2 blockade exhibited cross-priming of CD8+ T cells producing IFN xce xb3 in response to three tumor-specific antigens in tumor-draining lymph nodes which was not evident for single modality treatment. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in mouse tumors showed a significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells only in mice treated with the combination of RT+TGF xce xb2 blockade. Depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells abrogated the therapeutic benefit of RT+TGF xce xb2 blockade. These data identify TGF xce xb2 as a master inhibitor of the ability of RT to generate an in situ tumor vaccine which supports testing inhibition of TGF xce xb2 during radiotherapy to promote therapeutically effective anti-tumor immunity. We used genome-wide microarray to depict main biological processes responsibles for the therapeutic benefit of the combination ofTGF-beta blockade and local radiotherapy. To gain a more comprehensice protrait of the effects of RT and TGFbeta blockade on gene expressionin tumors we collected 4T1 tumors 4 days after completion of RT. Three tumors from each group were then subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on affymetrix array.","title":"Gene expression data from 4T1 irradiated tumors treated with TGFbeta blockade - nasa_genelab_GLDS-160_t729-nms2","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-160","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Gene expression data from 4T1 irradiated tumors treated with TGFbeta blockade"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/rodent-research-1-rr1-nasa-validation-flight-mouse-liver-transcriptomic-proteomic-and-epig","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["sample collection","gravitation","rna library construction","mass spectrometry","proteomics data transformation","labeling","mass spectrometry protocol","dna library construction","epitranscriptomics","extraction","nucleic acid sequencing","5mc total rna methylation analysis","protein extraction","dissection condition","nucleic acid extraction","library construction"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-48_t73x-bkpx","description":"RR-1 is a validation flight to evaluate the hardware operational and science capabilities of the Rodent Research Project on the ISS.

The experiment involved an implantable subcutaneous nanochannel delivery system (nDS; between scapula) which delivered the drug formoterol (FMT; a selective  xce xb22 adrenoceptor agonist) over the course of time. To this end a cohort of forty 32-weeks-old female C57BL/6NTac mice were either sham operated or implanted with vehicle or treatment-filled nDS launched in two Transporters (20 mice per Transporter) on SpaceX-13 on December 15 2017. They were transferred to Rodent Habitats onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and maintained in microgravity for 29 days (N=20 Live Animal Return Spaceflight [LAR FLT]) or >50 days (N=20 ISS Terminal Spaceflight [ISS-T FLT]). After 29 days the 20 LAR FLT animals were returned live to back to Earth on January 13 2018. After splashdown the animals were ambulatory on-ground for ~4 days until all subjects were processed during one day of dissections. There were two Basal (BSL) groups of animals sacrificed (LAR BSL & ISS-T BSL; N=20; 40 animals; ~36 weeks old) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC; 12/9/17). LAR BSL animals were dissected and samples were collected upon euthanasia. A Ground Control (GC) group LAR GC mimicked the LAR FLT group which was housed at KSC then shipped alive to Novartis xe2 x80 x99s Facilities where both the LAR FLT and LAR GC groups were processed (~41 weeks old; 1/16/18). All were anesthetized with isoflurane blood samples were obtained by closed-chest cardiac puncture and the animals were euthanized by exsanguination and thoracotomy. The 20 ISS-T FLT mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine over the course of a four days of dissections (2/6/18 until 2/9/18; 53-56 days after launch; 44 weeks old at time of on-orbit dissections). Blood samples and euthanasia were conducted the same as LAR groups. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection the ISS-T FLT animal carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80 xcb x9aC or colder until return. The ISS-T Ground Control (ISS-T GC) (at KSC) followed the same euthanasia timeline methods and preservation. The final processing of frozen ISS-T FLT frozen ISS-T GC and frozen 0-day ISS-T BSL animals were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute in Houston TX (5/21/18 until 5/24/18). GeneLab received feces from only sham treated animals (no drug treated animals) from the following groups. FLT: LAR (n=9) ISS-T (n=7); GC: LAR (N=7) ISS-T (N=9); BSL: LAR (n=7) ISS-T (n=9).

Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS) it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. NASA  s GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics systems biology-based approach and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA DNA and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic transcriptomic and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands quadriceps gastrocnemius tibialis anterior extensor digitorum longus soleus eye and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions and thus the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.","title":"Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse kidney transcriptomic proteomic and epigenomic data - nasa_genelab_GLDS-102_tjd5-xb2g","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-102","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse kidney transcriptomic proteomic and epigenomic data"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/validation-of-methods-to-assess-the-immunoglobulin-gene-repertoire-in-tissues-obtained-fro","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["sample collection - whole spleen","library construction","library construction 1","library construction 2","nucleic acid extraction","nucleic acid sequencing","rna sequencing","sample collection","sample collection protocol","sample collection - spleen cells","sample collection - spleen tissue"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-141_tkub-4ty6","description":"Spaceflight is known to affect immune cell populations.

However skeletal muscle tissue is of paramount importance for health maintenance (e.g. being essential to locomotion heat production and metabolism). To better prevent or eventually treat microgravity-induced muscle atrophy its underlying mechanisms have first to be characterized in detail. Using cutting-edge quantitative proteomics the aim of the present study was therefore to get an in depth view of the molecular regulations triggered by space conditions in skeletal muscles of mice during the 30-day flight of the BION-M1 biosatellite. As muscles differing in their fiber type composition appear to respond differently to microgravity (see above) we characterized here the differential response of the soleus extensor digitorum longus and vastus lateralis muscles.","title":"Mouse muscle LC-MSMS upon weightlessness - nasa_genelab_GLDS-139_u5yv-j7u3","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-139","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Mouse muscle LC-MSMS upon weightlessness"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/sts-135-cerebellum-transcriptomics","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["mouse habitation","sample collection","nucleic acid hybridization","labeling","rna extraction","radiation dosimetry","data collection","cosmic radiation","spaceflight"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-222_u6gc-g7k9","description":"Mice were flown onboard STS-135 and returned to Earth for analysis.

Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS) it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. NASA  s GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics systems biology-based approach and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA DNA and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic transcriptomic and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands quadriceps gastrocnemius tibialis anterior extensor digitorum longus soleus eye and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions and thus the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.","title":"Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse eye transcriptomic and epigenomic data - nasa_genelab_GLDS-100_ub2r-ewb8","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-100","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse eye transcriptomic and epigenomic data"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gazetteer-of-planetary-nomenclature-nasa-000003873","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1977-01-01/2014-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["wise","nen","geography","space science"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Jennifer Blue","hasEmail":"mailto:jblue@usgs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000038__73","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

NASA  s GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics systems biology-based approach and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA DNA and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic transcriptomic and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands quadriceps gastrocnemius tibialis anterior extensor digitorum longus soleus eye and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions and thus the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.","title":"Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse adrenal gland transcriptomic proteomic and epigenomic data - nasa_genelab_GLDS-98_v554-yj97","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-98","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse adrenal gland transcriptomic proteomic and epigenomic data"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/transient-gene-expression-profile-changes-of-confluent-human-fibroblast-cells-in-spaceflig","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["mrna normalization data transformation","rna extraction","sample collection","nucleic acid hybridization","spaceflight","time","mrna labeling","mirna data transformation","data collection","mirna nucleic acid hybridization","normalization data transformation","data transformation","labeling","mrna data collection","mrna nucleic acid hybridization","mirna data collection","mirna labeling"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-118_v5nq-hfkp","description":"Microgravity or an altered gravity environment from the static 1g has been shown to influence global gene expression patterns and protein levels in cultured cells or animals but it is unclear how these changes in gene and protein expressions are related to each other or are related to other factors regulating such changes.

These animals are particularly promising because of their central role in the limnic food web and its mode of reproduction. However the response of Daphnia to altered gravity conditions has to be investigated especially on the molecular level to evaluate the suitability of Daphnia for BLSS in space. Methods: In this study we applied a proteomic approach to identify key proteins and pathways involved in the response of Daphnia to simulated microgravity generated by a 2D-clinostat. We analysed 5 biological replicates using 2D-DIGE proteomic analysis. Results: We identified 109 protein spots differing in intensity (p < 0.05). Substantial fractions of these proteins are involved in actin microfilament organisation indicating the disruption of cytoskeletal structures during clinorotation. Furthermore proteins involved in protein folding were identified suggesting altered gravity induced breakdown of protein structures in general. In addition simulated microgravity increased the abundance of energy metabolism related proteins indicating an enhanced energy demand of Daphnia. Conclusion: The affected biological processes were also described in other studies using different organisms and systems either aiming to simulate microgravity conditions or providing real microgravity conditions. Moreover most of the Daphnia protein sequences are well conserved throughout taxa indicating that the response to altered gravity conditions in Daphnia follows a general concept.","title":"The influence of simulated microgravity on the proteome of Daphnia magna - nasa_genelab_GLDS-110_veav-wqwk","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-110","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"The influence of simulated microgravity on the proteome of Daphnia magna"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/rna-seq-transcriptome-analysis-of-reactive-oxygen-species-gene-network-in-mizuna-plants-gr","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["data transformation","library construction","nucleic acid sequencing","sample collection","genelab rnaseq data processing protocol","spaceflight","nucleic acid extraction"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-59_vft3-2fpx","description":"Space environment is suspected to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce oxidative stress in plants however little is known about the gene expression of ROS gene network in plants grown in long-term space flight. RNA-Seq was used to define the large-scale gene expression profiles of Mizuna harvested after 27 days cultivation in the international space station to understand the molecular response and adaptation to space environment.Results: Total reads of transcripts from the Mizuna grown in the international space station as well as on the ground by RNA-Seq using next generation sequencing technology showed 8,258 and 14,170 transcripts up- and down-regulated in the space-grown Mizuna respectively when compared with those from the ground-grown Mizuna. A total of 20 in 32 ROS oxidative marker genes were up-regulated including high expression of 4 hallmarks and preferentially expressed gene associated with ROS-scavenging genes was thioredoxin glutaredoxin and alternative oxidase genes. In the transcription factors of ROS gene network MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3 OXI1-MKK4-MPK3 and OXI1-MPK3 of MAP cascades induction of WRKY22 by MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3 cascade induction of WRKY25 and repression of ZAT7 by Zat12 were suggested. RbohD and RbohF genes were up-regulated preferentially in NADPH oxidase genes which produce ROS.Conclusions: Our large-scale transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the space environment induced oxidative stress and ROS gene network was activated in the space-grown Mizuna some of which were common genes up-regulated by abiotic and biotic stress and were preferentially up-regulated genes by the space environment even though Mizuna grew in the space as well as on the ground showing that plants could acclimate to the space environment by reprograming the expression of ROS gene network.","title":"RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis of reactive oxygen species gene network in Mizuna plants grown in long-term space flight - nasa_genelab_GLDS-59_vft3-2fpx","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-59","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis of reactive oxygen species gene network in Mizuna plants grown in long-term space flight"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/deorbit-descent-and-landing-flight-1-ddl-f1","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-07-27","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-31","keyword":["precision-landing","landing-sensors","terrain-relative-navigation"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Kevin Somervill","hasEmail":"mailto:kevin.m.somervill@nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"NASA"},"identifier":"vicw-ivgd","description":"This data was recorded during Flight 1 of the Blue Origin Deorbit, Descent, and Landing Tipping Point (BODDL-TP) Game Changing Development (GCD) Program.

In this study we examine the impact of microgravity on the interactions between the squid Euprymna scolopes and its beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri which form a highly specific binary mutualism. First animals inoculated with V. fischeri aboard the space shuttle showed effective colonization of the host light organ the site of the symbiosis during spaceflight. Second RNA-Seq analysis of squid exposed to modeled microgravity conditions exhibited extensive differential gene expression in the presence and absence of the symbiotic partner. Transcriptomic analyses revealed in the absence of the symbiont during modeled microgravity there was an enrichment of genes and pathways associated with the innate immune and oxidative stress response. The results suggest that V. fischeri may help modulate the host stress responses under modeled microgravity. This study provides a window into the adaptive responses that the host animal and its symbiont use during modeled microgravity.","title":"Effect of microgravity on an animal-bacteria symbiosis - nasa_genelab_GLDS-119_vqb8-588u","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-119","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Effect of microgravity on an animal-bacteria symbiosis"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/the-arabidopsis-spaceflight-transcriptome-a-comparison-of-whole-plants-to-discrete-root-hy","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["spaceflight","reverse_transcription","labeling","nucleic_acid_extraction","p-mtab-28101","hybridization","grow","genelab microarray data processing protocol","data transformation","bioassay_data_transformation","p-mtab-28102","p-mtab-28103","p-mtab-28104","organism part","p-mtab-28105","p-mtab-28106","p-mtab-28107"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-7_vqng-7euz","description":"Arabidopsis thaliana was evaluated for its response to the spaceflight environment in three replicated experiments on the International Space Station.

Because VIIP and IIH share some neurologic and ophthalmologic manifestations, the latter might be used as a model to study some of the processes underlying VIIP. This work constitutes a preliminary investigation of the molecular pathways associated with the elevation of ICP in IIH. Gene expression signatures were obtained from exosomes collected from CSF and plasma in patients with possible signs of IIH. The gene expression targets focused on inflammatory genes and miRNAs. The results suggest that inflammatory cytokine-driven processes and immune cell migration are activated when ICP is elevated in IIH patients, either as a cause or effect of the ICP increase. Several miRNAs appear to be involved in this response, among which miR-9 and miR-16 are upregulated in CSF and plasma of higher ICP subjects. This study provides evidence in support of neurophysiological alterations and neuro-immunomodulation in this condition. If similar changes are seen in astronauts manifesting with the VIIP syndrome, an underlying pathophysiological basis may be discovered.']","title":"['Inflammatory gene expression signatures in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: possible implications in microgravity-induced ICP elevation - Plasma']","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-364","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"['Inflammatory gene expression signatures in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: possible implications in microgravity-induced ICP elevation - Plasma']"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/calipso-lidar-l2-5-km-cloud-profile-data-v3-02","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"2011-11-01/2013-02-28","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["eos","satellite","climate","atmospheric science","cloud","aerosol","radiation"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"John M.

Transforming growth factor  xce xb2 (TGF xce xb2) is an immunosuppressive cytokine that is activated by RT and inhibits the antigen-presenting function of dendritic cells and the differentiation of effector CD8+ T cells. Here we tested the hypothesis that TGF xce xb2 hinders the ability of RT to promote anti-tumor immunity. Development of tumor-specific immunity was examined in a pre-clinical model of metastatic breast cancer. Mice bearing established 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma treated with pan-isoform specific TGF xce xb2 neutralizing antibody 1D11 showed significantly improved control of the irradiated tumor and non-irradiated metastases but no effect in the absence of RT. Notably whole tumor transcriptional analysis demonstrated the selective upregulation of genes associated with immune-mediated rejection only in tumors of mice treated with RT+TGF xce xb2 blockade. Mice treated with RT+TGF xce xb2 blockade exhibited cross-priming of CD8+ T cells producing IFN xce xb3 in response to three tumor-specific antigens in tumor-draining lymph nodes which was not evident for single modality treatment. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in mouse tumors showed a significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells only in mice treated with the combination of RT+TGF xce xb2 blockade. Depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells abrogated the therapeutic benefit of RT+TGF xce xb2 blockade. These data identify TGF xce xb2 as a master inhibitor of the ability of RT to generate an in situ tumor vaccine which supports testing inhibition of TGF xce xb2 during radiotherapy to promote therapeutically effective anti-tumor immunity. We used genome-wide microarray to depict main biological processes responsibles for the therapeutic benefit of the combination ofTGF-beta blockade and local radiotherapy. To gain a more comprehensice protrait of the effects of RT and TGFbeta blockade on gene expressionin tumors we collected 4T1 tumors 4 days after completion of RT. Three tumors from each group were then subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on affymetrix array.","title":"Gene expression data from 4T1 irradiated tumors treated with TGFbeta blockade - nasa_genelab_GLDS-160_vz54-rnde","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-160","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Gene expression data from 4T1 irradiated tumors treated with TGFbeta blockade"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/microarray-analysis-of-space-flown-murine-thymus-tissue-nasagenelabglds-4w2wr-cwjf","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["data transformation","labeling","normalization data transformation","rna extraction","growth protocol","scan protocol","spaceflight","treatment protocol","genelab microarray data processing protocol","radiation dosimetry","nucleic acid hybridization","cosmic radiation"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-4_w2wr-cwjf","description":"Microarray Analysis of Space-flown Murine Thymus Tissue Reveals Changes in Gene Expression Regulating Stress and Glucocorticoid Receptors.

To this end a cohort of forty 32-weeks-old female C57BL/6NTac mice were either sham operated or implanted with vehicle or treatment-filled nDS launched in two Transporters (20 mice per Transporter) on SpaceX-13 on December 15 2017. They were transferred to Rodent Habitats onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and maintained in microgravity for 29 days (N=20 Live Animal Return [LAR]) or >50 days (N=20 ISS Terminal). After 29 days the 20 LAR animals were returned live to back to Earth on January 13 2018,. After splashdown the animals were ambulatory on-ground for ~4 days until all subjects were processed during one day of dissections. There were two Baseline groups of animals sacrificed (LAR Baseline & FLT Baseline; N=20; 40 animals; ~36 weeks old) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC; 12/9/17). A Ground Control group mimicked the Flight LAR group which was housed at KSC then shipped alive to Novartis   Facilities where both the LAR and LAR Ground Control groups were processed (~41 weeks old; 1/16/18). All were anesthetized with isoflurane blood samples were obtained by closed-chest cardiac puncture and the animals were euthanized by exsanguination and thoracotomy. The 20 ISS Terminal mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine over the course of a four days of dissections (2/6/18 until 2/9/18; 53-56 days after launch; 44 weeks old at time of on-orbit dissections). Blood samples and euthanasia were conducted the same as LAR and Baseline. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection the ISS-terminal animal carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return. The ISS-terminal Ground Controls (at KSC) followed the same euthanasia timeline methods and preservation.

To address this problem we designed installed and flight-validated a novel Aircraft Bioaerosol Collector (ABC) for NASA  s C-20A that can make collections for microbiological research investigations up to altitudes of 13.7 km. Herein we report results from the first set of science flights xe2 x80 x94four consecutive missions flown over the United States (US) from 30 October to 2 November 2017. To ascertain how the concentration of airborne bacteria changed across the tropopause we collected air during aircraft Ascent/Descent (0.3 to 11 km) as well as sustained Cruise altitudes in the lower stratosphere (~12 km). Bioaerosols were captured on DNA-treated gelatinous filters inside a cascade air sampler then analyzed with molecular and culture-based characterization. Several viable bacterial isolates were recovered from flight altitudes including Bacillus sp. Micrococcus sp. Arthrobacter sp. and Staphylococcus sp. from Cruise samples and Brachybacterium sp. from Ascent/Descent samples. Using 16S V4 sequencing methods for a culture-independent analysis of bacteria the average number of total OTUs was 305 for Cruise samples and 276 for Ascent/Descent samples. Some taxa were more abundant in the flight samples than the ground samples including OTUs from families Lachnospiraceae Ruminococcaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae as well as the following genera: Clostridium Mogibacterium Corynebacterium Bacteroides Prevotella Pseudomonas and Parabacteroides. Surprisingly our results revealed a homogeneous distribution of bacteria in the atmosphere up to 12 km. The observation could be due to atmospheric conditions producing similar background aerosols across the western US as suggested by modeled back trajectories and satellite measurements. However the influence of aircraft-associated bacterial contaminants could not be fully eliminated and that background signal was reported throughout our dataset. Considering the tremendous engineering challenge of collecting biomass at extreme altitudes where contamination from flight hardware remains an ever-present issue we note the utility of using the stratosphere as a proving ground for planned life detection missions across the solar system.","title":"NASA Aircraft Bioaerosol Collector (ABC) - nasa_genelab_GLDS-170_w849-kkga","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-170","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"NASA Aircraft Bioaerosol Collector (ABC)"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/proton-irradiation-augments-the-reduction-in-tumor-progression-observed-with-advanced-age-","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["sample collection","data collection","age","treatment protocol","rna extraction","nucleic acid hybridization","normalization data transformation","labeling","ionzing radiation"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-131_wbc9-fzkr","description":"Proton irradiation is touted for its improved tumor targeting due to the physical advantages of ion beams for radiotherapy. Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that in addition to targeting advantages proton irradiation can inhibit angiogenic and immune factors and thereby modulate tumor progression. High-energy protons also constitute a principal component of the galactic cosmic rays to which astronauts are exposed. Increased understanding of the biological effects of proton exposure would thus contribute to both improved cancer therapy and carcinogenesis risk assessment for space travel. In addition age plays a major role in tumor incidence and is a critical consideration for estimating cancer risk. We investigated the effects of host age and proton exposure on tumor progression. Tumor lag time and growth dynamics were tracked following injection of murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells into young (68 day) versus old (736 day) mice with or without coincident irradiation. Tumor progression was suppressed in old compared to young mice. Differences in progression were further modulated by proton irradiation (1GeV) with increased inhibition evident in old mice. Through global transcriptome analysis TGFB1 and TGFB2 were determined to be key players that contributed to the tumor dynamics observed. These findings point to older hosts providing decreased systemic tumor support which can be further inhibited by proton irradiation. Overall design: For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina San Diego CA) were used. Total RNA was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification Kit (Ambion Austin TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. For tumor replicates thirty tumor samples from adolescent and thirty tumor samples from old mice for a total of 60 tumor samples were used. All replicate samples were run individually. For each age group ten tumor samples had received proton irradiation while twenty tumor samples were from unirradiated mice (as described above). Total RNA was isolated and purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and quantified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had 28s/18s = 2:1 RIN >7. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using AmbionTotalPrep and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan System. The data was checked with GenomeStudio (Illumina) for quality control. In GenomeStudio data was background subtracted and rank invariant normalization was applied. Data was imported into MultiExperiment Viewer MeV for statistical analysis. The statistically significant genes were determined using MeV by applying a one-way ANOVA analysis with standard Bonferroni correction with a FDR <0.05 that resulted in a list of significant genes.

Moreover in an effort to identify a specific stress response of R. rubrum to space flight ground simulation of space ionizing radiation and space gravity were performed under identical culture setup and growth conditions encountered during the actual space journey. This study is unique in combining the results from an actual space experiment with the corresponding space ionizing radiation and modeled microgravity ground simulations which lead to a more solid dissection of the different factors contribution acting in space flight conditions.

Unsupervised clustering analysis of gene expression segregated samples according to the radiation (IR) response and time after exposure with 56Fe-IR showing the greatest level of gene modulation. 1H-IR exposures showed little differential transcript modulation. Network analysis categorized the major differentially expressed genes into cell cycle oxidative responses and transcriptional regulation functional groups. Transcriptional networks identified key nodes regulating expression. Individual transcription factors were inferred to be active at 1 3 7 14 and 28 days after exposure. Validation of the signal transduction network by protein analysis showed that particle IR clearly regulates a long lived signaling mechanism for p38 MAPK signaling and NFATc4 activation. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays supported the role of additional key transcription factors GATA-4 STAT-3 and NF-kB as regulators of the response at specific time points. These data suggest that the molecular response to 56Fe-IR is unique and shows long-lasting gene expression in cardiomyocytes up to 28 days after exposure. Additionally proteins involved in signal transduction and transcriptional activation via DNA binding play a role in the response to high charge (Z) and energy (E) particles (HZE).

Laboratory-controlled hypobaria however allows the dissection of pressure effects away from the effects typically associated with altitude in particular hypoxia as the partial pressure of O2 can be varied. In this study whole transcriptomes of plants grown in ambient (97 kPa/pO2 = 21 kPa) atmospheric conditions were compared to those of plants transferred to five different atmospheres of varying pressure and oxygen composition for 24 h: 50 kPa/pO2 = 10 kPa 25 kPa/pO2 = 5 kPa 50 kPa/pO2 = 21 kPa 25 kPa/pO2 = 21 kPa or 97 kPa/pO2 = 5 kPa. The plants exposed to these environments were 10 day old Arabidopsis seedlings grown vertically on hydrated nutrient plates. In addition 5 day old plants were also exposed for 24 h to the 50 kPa and ambient environments to evaluate age-dependent responses. The gene expression profiles from roots and shoots showed that the hypobaric response contained more complex gene regulation than simple hypoxia and that adding back oxygen to normoxic conditions did not completely alleviate gene expression changes in hypobaric responses.","title":"Dissecting Low Atmospheric Pressure Stress: Transcriptome Responses to the Components of Hypobaria in Arabidopsis [Experiment 1] - nasa_genelab_GLDS-134_wkwg-a6gy","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-134","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Dissecting Low Atmospheric Pressure Stress: Transcriptome Responses to the Components of Hypobaria in Arabidopsis [Experiment 1]"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/proteome-profiling-of-the-exhaled-breath-condensate-after-long-term-spaceflights","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["['\"spaceflight\"' '\"time\"']","['\"sample collection\"' '\"extraction\"' '\"mass spectrometry\"' '\"data transformation\"']"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-359_wmcd-d5pu","description":"['\"The aim of the study was to analyze exhaled breath condensate (EBC) proteome changes due to the effects of spaceflight factors.

However the specific physiological response of caries-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space flight and/or ground-based simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study High Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV) S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles H2O2 resistance and competence in sucrose-containing biofilm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H2O2 compared to normal gravity control cultures but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated >= 2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated >= 2-fold during simulated microgravity HARV growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism translation and stress responses. Collectively these results suggest that growth under microgravity analog conditions promotes changes in S. mutans gene expression and physiology that may translate to an altered cariogenic potential of this organism during space flight missions.

Through a Systems Biology approach our previous NASA work has shown both TGF xce xb2 signaling pathways and miRNAs have a critical impact on defining health risks with and without space irradiation. We hypothesize that circulating microRNA (miRNA) signatures are driving microvascular disease and muscle degeneration associated with accelerating aging and will be enhanced by exposure to the space environment (radiation and microgravity). We investigated this hypothesis both in vivo and in vitro and test novel antagonist therapies to these miRNA signatures as countermeasures to reduce space radiation-induced health risks. A comprehensive Systems Biology approach was used to examine the influence by high atomic number by high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) (HZE) irradiation. To simulate low-dose exposure due to galactic cosmic rays (GCR) we used the ions energy and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula of 7 different ions to represent GCR (referred to as GCR sim model). To simulate high-dose radiation exposure due to solar particle events (SPE) we used an acute dose of SPE simulated beam at 1Gy which has energies ranging from 50MeV to 150MeV. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were utilized for irradiation with our established simulated microgravity model (hindlimb suspension model) and an in vitro 3D microvasculature tissue model under simulated microgravity (clinostat) conditions will also be irradiated. To expand on the circulating miRNA signature determined from our preliminary data we determined a group of conserved miRNAs which are commonly being regulated in the majority of the organs and tissues throughout the host using our established techniques. MiRNA-sequencing on serum (before IR and at time of sacrifice) liver heart and muscle tissue for all radiation groups revealed the key circulating miRNA signature (consisting of multiple miRNAs) impacting disease risk. Collectively understanding of how whole body space radiation impacts microvascular and tissue degeneration through circulating miRNAs will greatly enhance health risk prognostication and provide possible new mechanisms for protection against space radiation.","title":"miRNA signature detection and countermeasures against HZE radiation exposure for tissue degeneration-Soleus muscle","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-337","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"miRNA signature detection and countermeasures against HZE radiation exposure for tissue degeneration-Soleus muscle"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/gateway-to-astronaut-photography-of-earth-nasa-000003717","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"1977-01-01/1996-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["wise","space science","geography","nen"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"William Stefanov","hasEmail":"mailto:jsc-earthweb@nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"NASA-0000037__17","description":"Planetary nomenclature, like terrestrial nomenclature, is used to uniquely identify a feature on the surface of a planet or satellite so that the feature can be easily located, described, and discussed.

Examination of the microarray data revealed 970 individual probes that had a 1.5 fold or greater change. When these data were averaged (n=4) we identified 12 genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated by at least 1.5 fold after spaceflight (p?0.05).

In this study we performed whole lung C-ion irradiation using three different strains of mice to examine whether strain-dependent differences in radiation effects occur in high-LET C-ion thoracic irradiation. Murine strain-variance was evaluated by histopathological examination of intra-alveolar hemorrhage that is likely to occur during the early phase after irradiation and of lung fibrosis during the late phase occurring more than three months after irradiation. We also performed microarray analysis to identify the key genes that are differentially regulated in different mouse strains after C-ion irradiation and to determine the mechanism of strain-dependent pulmonary damage after high-LET C-ion irradiation. Eight-week old female inbred C3H/He Slc C57BL/6J Jms Slc and A/J Jms Slc mice (3 kinds of mice) were used. The whole thorax of three mice was locally irradiated at 10 Gy with C-ion beams with a reference beam 137Cs gamma-rays (2 kinds of beam). Three mice of each strain (3 mice) were sacrificed and immediately dissected for lung extraction at 6 h (6h sample). Lungs for three mice of each strain without irradiation were extracted at the same time as control samples (control sample).

We used flow cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during flight to define the differentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; including CD11b CD31 CD44 Ly6C Ly6G F4/80 Mac2 c-Fos as well as c-Fms. In addition RNA was preserved during the flight and was used to perform a gene microarray. We found that there were significant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth. We found that there were significant changes in the distribution of cells that expressed CD11b CD31 F4/80 Mac2 Ly6C and c-Fos. However there were no changes in c-Fms expression and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded differentiation during space flight. We also found a pattern of transcript levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome but increased proliferation by the bone marrow macrophages that were assayed after 14 days of space flight. There also was a surprising pattern of space flight influence on genes of the coagulation pathway.

The global effects of the three types of high-LET radiations (fast neutron heavy ion (C) and thermal neutron) were compared with the low-LET radiation (gamma ray) using yeast DNA microarrays. Highly induced genes by the three types of high-LET radiations were those genes related to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress was one of the common factors associated with the four types of radiations. Oxidative stress induced by high-LET radiations may be more serious than that induced by gamma rays. Additionally genes related to protein synthesis and the ubiquitin and proteasome system were detected. This suggests that more protein damages can be induced by high-LET radiation that denatures the proteins in yeast cells. The genes specifically altered by each type of high-LET radiation were also studied. Overall design: This series contains 4 kinds of irradiation-induced gene expression profiles. Triplicates hybridization was done in each irradiation exposure and each array have high and low power scanned data respectively. All biological samples were collected independently.","title":"Gene-expression profiling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae irradiated by high-LET radiations - nasa_genelab_GLDS-97_xunx-hnnk","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-97","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Gene-expression profiling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae irradiated by high-LET radiations"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/rodent-research-1-rr1-nasa-validation-flight-mouse-soleus-muscle-transcriptomic-and-epigen","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["rna library construction","microgravity","sample collection","library construction","nucleic acid extraction","dna library construction","animal and tissue sampling","nucleic acid sequencing"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-104_xuqe-zc2f","description":"NASA  s Rodent Research (RR) project is playing a critical role in advancing biomedical research on the physiological effects of space environments.

The current investigation assessed viability of RNA DNA and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic transcriptomic and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands quadriceps gastrocnemius tibialis anterior extensor digitorum longus soleus eye and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions and thus the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.","title":"Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse soleus muscle transcriptomic and epigenomic data - nasa_genelab_GLDS-104_xuqe-zc2f","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-104","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse soleus muscle transcriptomic and epigenomic data"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/dynamic-gene-expression-response-to-altered-gravity-in-human-t-cells-sounding-rocket-fligh","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-09-05","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["scan protocol","rna extraction","normalization data transformation","labeling","microgravity","nucleic acid hybridization","treatment protocol","growth protocol"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-188_xuvj-a3rb","description":"We investigated differentially regulated genes in human Jurkat T lymphocytic cells in 20s and 5min microgravity and in hypergravity and compared expression profiles to identify potential gravity-regulated genes and adaptation processes.","title":"Dynamic gene expression response to altered gravity in human T cells (sounding rocket flight) - nasa_genelab_GLDS-188_xuvj-a3rb","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-188","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Dynamic gene expression response to altered gravity in human T cells (sounding rocket flight)"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/calipso-lidar-l2-vertical-feature-mask-data-v3-02","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-25","temporal":"2011-11-01/2013-02-28","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-29","keyword":["radiation","eos","aerosol","satellite","cloud","climate","atmospheric science"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"John M.

Comparative analysis of the transcriptomes (using RNASeq) in dry seeds and upon controlled artificial aging treatment (CAAT) revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with spaceflight and ageing. DEG categories enriched by spaceflight and CAAT included transcription and translation with reduced transcript abundances for 40S and 60S ribosomal subunit genes.

Therefore we performed a dose-course transcriptional analysis for radiation exposure at 0 0.3 1.5 and 3.0 Gy with corresponding time point at 1 hour (hr) post-exposure using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST v1 Array chips. The analysis of our data suggests a set of sensitive genetic biomarkers specific to each radiation level as well as generic radiation response biomarkers.

Through a Systems Biology approach our previous NASA work has shown both TGF xce xb2 signaling pathways and miRNAs have a critical impact on defining health risks with and without space irradiation. We hypothesize that circulating microRNA (miRNA) signatures are driving microvascular disease and muscle degeneration associated with accelerating aging and will be enhanced by exposure to the space environment (radiation and microgravity). We investigated this hypothesis both in vivo and in vitro and test novel antagonist therapies to these miRNA signatures as countermeasures to reduce space radiation-induced health risks. A comprehensive Systems Biology approach was used to examine the influence by high atomic number by high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) (HZE) irradiation. To simulate low-dose exposure due to galactic cosmic rays (GCR) we used the ions energy and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula of 7 different ions to represent GCR (referred to as GCR sim model). To simulate high-dose radiation exposure due to solar particle events (SPE) we used an acute dose of SPE simulated beam at 1Gy which has energies ranging from 50MeV to 150MeV. C57BL/6 wild-type mice were utilized for irradiation with our established simulated microgravity model (hindlimb suspension model) and an in vitro 3D microvasculature tissue model under simulated microgravity (clinostat) conditions will also be irradiated. To expand on the circulating miRNA signature determined from our preliminary data we determined a group of conserved miRNAs which are commonly being regulated in the majority of the organs and tissues throughout the host using our established techniques. MiRNA-sequencing on serum (before IR and at time of sacrifice) liver heart and muscle tissue for all radiation groups revealed the key circulating miRNA signature (consisting of multiple miRNAs) impacting disease risk. Collectively understanding of how whole body space radiation impacts microvascular and tissue degeneration through circulating miRNAs will greatly enhance health risk prognostication and provide possible new mechanisms for protection against space radiation.","title":"miRNA signature detection and countermeasures against HZE radiation exposure for tissue degeneration-Heart tissue","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-334","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"miRNA signature detection and countermeasures against HZE radiation exposure for tissue degeneration-Heart tissue"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/microbiomes-of-the-dust-particles-collected-from-the-international-space-station-and-space","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid extraction   library construction   nucleic acid sequencing   sequence analysis data transformation   sample collection   sequence assembly","growth environment   target gene specification"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-26_y6cx-abd3","description":"The safety of the International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers and maintenance of ISS hardware are the primary rationale for monitoring microorganisms in this closed habitat.

ISS vacuum cleaner bag components (surface) and high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter element (air) samples were analyzed by traditional cultivation adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and propidium monoazide-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) assays to estimate viable microbial populations. In addition vacuum cleaner bag components of two cleanrooms at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL Pasadena CA) were examined concurrently. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing based on Illumina platform was used to elucidate the ISS microbial diversity and explore differences between the microbiomes of the ISS and Earth-based cleanrooms. The statistical analyses of these microbiomes show that Actinobacteria Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominate in the air and surface of the ISS and the cleanroom samples but vary in abundance. While members of Actinobacteria were predominant in the ISS Proteobacteria the least abundant phylum in the ISS dominated the Earth-based cleanrooms. The viable bacterial population (PMA-treated samples) decreased significantly but the treatment did not appear to have an effect on the bacterial composition (diversity) associated with a sampling site. Viable fungal sequences were not retrieved from the ISS HEPA sample where as highest viable fungal diversity was observed in the Earth-based cleanroom (JPL class 100K) debris. The results of this study provided strong evidence of substantial contribution of human skin-associated microorganisms such as Corynebacterium/Propionibacterium (Actinobacteria),not Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) species as the dominant species in the ISS in terms of viable and total bacterial community structure.","title":"Microbiomes of the Dust Particles Collected from the International Space Station and Spacecraft Assembly Facilities - nasa_genelab_GLDS-26_y6cx-abd3","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-26","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Microbiomes of the Dust Particles Collected from the International Space Station and Spacecraft Assembly Facilities"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/transcriptomic-analysis-of-liver-from-mice-subjected-to-simulated-spaceflight-euthanasia-f","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["genelab rnaseq data processing protocol","euthanasia","dissection condition","euthanasia method","data transformation","carcass preservation method","nucleic acid sequencing","sample collection","spike-in control","euthanasia animal","spike-in control protocol","tissue homogenate preservation time at -80c in rlt buffer","nucleic acid extraction","tissue preservation method","library construction"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-235_y6zh-skub","description":"To understand the molecular mechanisms affected by spaceflight it is essential to achieve high quality sample preservation on-orbit for downstream gene expression analysis.

Microarray analysis revealed that C. albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 454 genes compared to synchronous ground controls which represented 8.4% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation) which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to more normal bipolar budding patterns for ground samples in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally downregulation of genes involved in the actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested as this regulator is involved in random budding cell aggregation actin cytoskeleton and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. albicans. While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed. This study represents an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during spaceflight missions. Furthermore since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms with downstream benefits for the general public. Cells were grown for 24 hours on the space shuttle or as ground-based controls preserved in RNALater and stored at -80C. Four samples of each flight- and ground-based controls were harvested for microarray analysis. GAP is Group Activation Pack and each GAP contains 8 FPAs. The numbers represent the # assigned to the particular GAP and the number assigned to the specific FPA (1-8) within the indicated GAP. The same hardware is used for the flight samples and the ground samples.","title":"Candida albicans response to spaceflight (NASA STS-115) - nasa_genelab_GLDS-20_ynyt-d689","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-20","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Candida albicans response to spaceflight (NASA STS-115)"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/spaceflight-effects-on-the-mouse-retina-histological-gene-expression-and-epigenetic-change","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["normalization data transformation","labeling","growth protocol","cosmic radiation","data transformation","genelab microarray data processing protocol","nucleic acid hybridization","radiation dosimetry","rna extraction","sample collection","spaceflight"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-87_yp2y-32sv","description":"We report the findings of an animal experiment onboard STS-135 investigating the molecular aspects of the impact of spaceflight on retinal biology by performing differential gene expression profiling between mice flown onboard STS-135 and their ground control counterparts.","title":"Spaceflight effects on the mouse retina: Histological gene expression and epigenetic changes after flight on STS-135 - nasa_genelab_GLDS-87_yp2y-32sv","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-87","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Spaceflight effects on the mouse retina: Histological gene expression and epigenetic changes after flight on STS-135"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/the-influence-of-simulated-microgravity-on-the-proteome-of-daphnia-magna-nasagenelabglds-1","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["data transformation","labeling","mass spectrometry","data collection","sample collection","normalization","electrophoresis","extraction","weightlessness simulation","protein extraction"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-110_ypdm-m38q","description":"Background/Objectives: The waterflea Daphnia is an interesting candidate for bioregenerative life support systems (BLSS). These animals are particularly promising because of their central role in the limnic food web and its mode of reproduction. However the response of Daphnia to altered gravity conditions has to be investigated especially on the molecular level to evaluate the suitability of Daphnia for BLSS in space. Methods: In this study we applied a proteomic approach to identify key proteins and pathways involved in the response of Daphnia to simulated microgravity generated by a 2D-clinostat. We analysed 5 biological replicates using 2D-DIGE proteomic analysis. Results: We identified 109 protein spots differing in intensity (p < 0.05). Substantial fractions of these proteins are involved in actin microfilament organisation indicating the disruption of cytoskeletal structures during clinorotation. Furthermore proteins involved in protein folding were identified suggesting altered gravity induced breakdown of protein structures in general. In addition simulated microgravity increased the abundance of energy metabolism related proteins indicating an enhanced energy demand of Daphnia. Conclusion: The affected biological processes were also described in other studies using different organisms and systems either aiming to simulate microgravity conditions or providing real microgravity conditions. Moreover most of the Daphnia protein sequences are well conserved throughout taxa indicating that the response to altered gravity conditions in Daphnia follows a general concept.","title":"The influence of simulated microgravity on the proteome of Daphnia magna - nasa_genelab_GLDS-110_ypdm-m38q","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-110","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"The influence of simulated microgravity on the proteome of Daphnia magna"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/microbial-observatory-iss-mo-study-of-bsl-2-bacterial-isolates-from-the-international-spac","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid sequencing","truseq dna pcr-free was used as per manufacturer instruction","sequence assembly using  a5 genome assembler","sequence assembly","sample collection was done using sterile moisten wipes","sample collection","nucleic acid extraction was done usinq qiagen dna extraction kit as per manufacturer instruction","nucleic acid extraction","microgravity","library construction","illumina nextseq"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-67_yq97-t8md","description":"In an on-going Microbial Observatory experimental investigation on the International Space Station (ISS) multiple bacterial isolates of Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) were isolated and identified.

This was revealed by liquid growth experiments in a low shear environment and differential transcriptome analysis of FLO1 expressing cells compared to the non-flocculent wild-type cells. The results show that a floc provides a uniquely organized multicellular ultrastructure that provides a suitable microenvironment to induce and perform cell conjugation. S. cerevisiae strains BY4742 WT BY4742::FLO8 and BY4742 [FLO1] were grown in microgravity and 1-g. A transcriptomic analysis was performed and the transcriptome data were integrated with the high quality protein-protein interaction networks. The identified high score sub-networks (qvalue < 0.001) were considered and further evaluated concerning their GO enrichment using a hypogeometric test.

Thus identification and characterization of bystander mechanisms will help to development of new treatments of patients with a radiation exposure. In the present study we irradiated 3-dimensional tissue model of human epidermis Epi-200 (Mat-Tek Ashland MA) with 2.5 Gy protons. By exposing only a thin strip across the center of the EPI-200 tissue we have been able to measure global gene expression responses in directly irradiated and bystander cells located at 0.125-0.375 0.375-0.625 0.625-875 mm from the irradiation line. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH) and further gene ontology analysis and network analysis was performed with Panther (Applied Biosystems) and IPA (Ingenuity) accordingly. Significantly responding genes were identified at all distances and included sets common to both direct and bystander responses. False discovery rate in bystander samples did not exceed 20% (p=0.001) and was sufficiently low in the samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure (0.06-1.16%). Analysis of the fragments cut at the same distance revealed 52 54 and 88 differentially expressed genes. These gene lists overlapped each other had from 3 to 12 genes in common including CLED2 S100A7A. Samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure discovered 949 differentially expressed genes. Moreover the performed gene ontology analysis showed there overrepresentation of TP53 pathway (pathways p=2.04E-02) a common marker of direct irradiation response and also overrepresentation of the following groups of genes: signal transduction (p=4.52E-04) cell communication (p=1.24E-04) and cell cycle in the category of biological processes; DNA helicase activity (p=2.54E-07) receptor binding (p=6.19E-04) calcium ion binding proteins (p=2.57E-03) as the molecular functions. Differentially expresses genes of bystander samples had few categories in common such as cell communication (p=2.36E-03) and signal transduction (p=2.42E-03) among the biological processes and receptor activity (p=4.54E-03) among the molecular functions. Categories specific for the bystander samples included G-protein coupled receptors (p=7.24E-03) and ligand-gated ion channels (p=4.16E-03) suggesting a role of external stimulation and ion trafficking in bystander mechanisms. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model Epi-200 was measured in 16 hours after exposure to 2.5 Gy of protons. Four independent experiments were performed for the samples collected at different distances from the irradiation line (125-375 375-625 and 625-875 micrometers) using three tissue fragments per a data point. Moreover three sets of whole tissue irradited samples were also generated for 0 and 2.5 Gy (6 samples total) and used for comparison of bystander and direct responses.","title":"Bystander response to 2.5 Gy of protons in a human 3-dimensional skin model in 16 h after exposure - nasa_genelab_GLDS-151_ytvc-i83u","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-151","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Bystander response to 2.5 Gy of protons in a human 3-dimensional skin model in 16 h after exposure"}],"license":"http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/microbial-observatory-iss-mo-molecular-characterization-of-bacillus-issensis-sp-nov-isolat","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2018-06-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["nucleic acid extraction","nucleic acid sequencing","spaceflight","sequence assembly","sample processing","sample collection"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-64_yu4f-k7s9","description":"As part of an ongoing effort to catalogue microbial communities inhabiting the International Space Station (ISS) crew-associated environmental samples were collected from the Japanese Kibo Russian and US research modules. Initial analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified 11 Bacillus isolates (two from Kibo Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) four from US Segment Harmony Node 2 and five from Russian Segment Zvezda module sites) all belonging to the Bacillus anthracis-B. cereus-B. thuringiensis group. Isolates were further characterized by whole genome comparative analysis. Each isolate was sequenced assembled and aligned against all members of the B. cereus sensu lato group. Based on genome size estimates (5.2 - 5.3 Mbp) strain nucleotide identity (>99.99%) and maximum likelihood phylogenetic placement all isolates were found to exhibit a very high level of similarity. With respect to gene content all isolates were inspected for cry proteins common to B. thuringiensis as well as toxins specific to B. cereus. No significant hits were found to any known cry genes while full-length matches were found for multiple B. cereus toxin genes. Finally the isolates were closely screened against B. anthracis genomes and no B. anthracis signatures were identified. Notably all isolates contained the plcR ancestral C allele and lacked significant hits to pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids and toxins. The collective results from the analysis confirm that these strains belong to a previously uncharacterized Bacillus species hereafter referred to as Bacillus issensis. The type strain is ISSFR-003T (=NRRL B-65389T= DSMZ 101676T).","title":"Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO): Molecular characterization of Bacillus issensis sp. nov. isolated from various quarters of the International Space Station - nasa_genelab_GLDS-64_yu4f-k7s9","programCode":["026:005"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-64","description":"GeneLab Study Page","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO): Molecular characterization of Bacillus issensis sp. nov. isolated from various quarters of the International Space Station"}],"accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["Earth Science"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/a-study-of-alterations-dna-epigenetic-modifiincations-5mc-and-5hmc-influenced-by-simulated","bureauCode":["026:00"],"issued":"2021-05-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-01-26","keyword":["microgravity simulation","growth protocol","growth","nucleic acid extraction","nucleic acid sequencing","treatment","treatment protocol","library construction"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"GeneLab Outreach","hasEmail":"mailto:genelab-outreach@lists.nasa.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"},"identifier":"nasa_genelab_GLDS-86_yu6a-h5vm","description":"Here in this study we systematically examined the patterns of DNA methylation and hydroxy-methylation with its functional implications in gene regulation for the cultured TK6 lymphoblastoid cells upon exposure to micro-gravity conditions.

Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) encodes a large protein with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like domain at the C terminus (reviewed by Rotman and Shiloh 1998). PI3K-related proteins make up a large family of Ser-Thr protein kinases numerous members of which are involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression responses to DNA damage and the maintenance of genomic stability (Hoekstra 1997). AtATM plays an essential role in meiosis and in the somatic response to DNA damage in plants similar to the function of ATM in mammals and other eukaryotes.

The POWER Data Archive provides data at the native resolution of the source data products. The data is updated nightly to maintain Near Real Time (NRT) availability (2-3 days for meteorological parameters and 5-7 days for solar).\n\nThe POWER Project targets three specific user communities: Renewable Energy (RE), Sustainable Buildings (SB), and Agroclimatology (AG). The POWER Projects provides community specific parameters, output formats, naming conventions, and units that are commonly employed by each user community.\n\nThe POWER Services Catalog consists of a series of RESTful Application Programming Interfaces (API), geospatial enabled image services, and a web mapping Data Access Viewer (DAV). These three different service offerings support data discovery, access, and distribution to our user base as ARD and as direct application inputs to decision support tools.","title":"Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER)","programCode":["026:006"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://power.larc.nasa.gov/dashboard/","description":"Solar and meteorological data sets from NASA research for the support of renewable energy, building energy efficiency and agricultural needs.","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER)"},{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://power.larc.nasa.gov/docs/services/","description":"Solar and meteorological data sets from NASA research for the support of renewable energy, building energy efficiency and agricultural needs.","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER)"},{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://nasa.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=4b75def515df430980faebca6a007465","description":"Solar and meteorological data sets from NASA research for the support of renewable energy, building energy efficiency and agricultural needs.","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER)"},{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://power.larc.nasa.gov/beta/data-access-viewer/","description":"Solar and meteorological data sets from NASA research for the support of renewable energy, building energy efficiency and agricultural needs.","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER)"},{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://power.larc.nasa.gov/docs/tutorials/","description":"Solar and meteorological data sets from NASA research for the support of renewable energy, building energy efficiency and agricultural needs.","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER)"},{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://power.larc.nasa.gov/docs/methodology/","description":"Solar and meteorological data sets from NASA research for the support of renewable energy, building energy efficiency and agricultural needs.","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER)"},{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://power.larc.nasa.gov/api/pages/","description":"Solar and meteorological data sets from NASA research for the support of renewable energy, building energy efficiency and agricultural needs.","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER)"}],"spatial":"Global","dataQuality":true,"theme":["Earth Science"]}]}
